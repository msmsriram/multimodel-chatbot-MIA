The Societ y can refer you to a \\nprofessional in your area for help in dealing with this difﬁcult situation.\\nWhat is clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)?\\nIn multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. \\nThese make up the central nervous system, which controls everything we do. Damage from \\nthe attack disrupts signals to and from the brain and causes the symptoms of MS. Clinically \\nisolated syndrome (CIS) is one of the 4 multiple sclerosis disease courses. CIS refers to a ﬁrst \\nepisode of neurologic symptoms like those in MS. If you experience CIS, you may or may not \\ngo on to develop MS.To be considered CIS, the episode must:\\nl  Last at least 24 hours\\nl  Be caused by inﬂammation and demyelination (loss of the myelin that covers the nerve \\ncells) in the central nervous system An episode can include one or more than one symptom. \\nIt usually has no associated fever or infection and is followed by a complete or partial \\nrecovery.\\nCIS symptoms\\nIn CIS, your symptoms are linked to where the damage to the myelin occurred in the central \\nnervous system. You may have:\\nl  Vision problems, including optic neuritis, blurred vision, poor contrast or color vision and \\npain on eye movement\\nl  Numbness or tingling of the face, body or extremities (arms and legs)\\nl  Walking difﬁculties\\nl  Spasticit y\\nl  Fatigue\\nl  Weakness\\nl  Bladder and/or bowel problems\\nl  Dizziness\\nl  Sexual problems\\nWho gets CIS, and when?\\nLike MS, CIS is not directly inherited, and it is not contagious. CIS is 2 to 3 times more \\ncommon in women than men. Seventy percent of people diagnosed with CIS are between the \\nages of 20 and 40 years (the average age is 30). But people can develop CIS at older or \\nyounger ages.\\nHow is CIS different from MS?\\nBased upon clinical symptoms alone, CIS and MS may appear the same. In both, damage to \\nthe myelin sheath (demyelination) interferes with the way nerve impulses travel to and from \\nthe brain, resulting in neurologic symptoms.\\nl  A person with CIS, by deﬁnition, is experiencing the ﬁrst episode of symptoms caused by \\ninﬂammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. A person with MS has \\nexperienced more than one episode.\\nl  With CIS, an MRI may demonstr ate damage only in the area responsible for the current \\nsymptoms. With MS, there may be multiple lesions on MRI in different areas of the brain and \\nspinal cord.\\nCIS progression to MS\\nIf you have experienced CIS, you may or may not go on to develop MS. Your healthcare \\nprovider will do their best to determine the likelihood of this happening. Here are the criteria \\nthey use to make that determination:\\nl  High risk of developing MS: If a provider sees brain lesions similar to those in MS on \\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they predict that you have a 60% to 80% chance of a \\nsecond neurologic event and diagnosis of MS within several years.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='l  Low risk of developing MS: If CIS is not accompanied by MRI-detected brain lesions, \\nyou have about a 20% chance of developing MS over the same period of time.\\nl  Diagnosis of MS: If CIS is accompanied by MRI ﬁndings of old lesions or scars that \\nconﬁrm an earlier episode of damage in a different location in the central nervous system, \\nthen an MS diagnosis is conﬁrmed. The presence of oligoclonal bands in a person’ s \\ncerebrospinal ﬂuid can also help make the diagnosis.\\nAs MRI technology becomes more advanced, it is likely that the diagnosis of MS will be made \\nmore quickly and there will be fewer people diagnosed with CIS. A quicker diagnosis also \\nallows people to get treatment earlier and to slow their disease course.\\nFor those whose CIS does turn into MS, how long does it take?\\nNot everyone who has an episode of CIS goes on to receiv e an MS diagnosis. Only 63% of \\nthose who experience an episode of CIS go on to receiv e an MS diagnosis. It is impossible to \\npredict who will and in what period of time. Many factors contribute to this — including some \\nthat have not been identiﬁed yet.\\nIn addition, many people with CIS are using disease-modif ying therapies to delay (and in \\nsome cases prevent) MS. If you have had an episode of CIS and are not using a DMT, talk to \\nyour healthcare provider about treatment.\\nWhat factors inﬂuence whether or not CIS turns into MS?\\nResearchers have recogniz ed multiple variables and risk factors that play a role in the \\npotential for CIS to convert to MS. These include:\\nl  Younger age of disease onset\\nl  Male gender\\nl  The number of MRI lesions\\nl  Oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal ﬂuid\\nThis list is not exhaustiv e.  Also, the items in this list do not always apply to each person with \\nCIS. For instance, all men with CIS are not guar anteed to get MS . Finally , there are also a \\nnumber of risk factors associated with MS, like vitamin D deﬁciency and smoking, that you \\ncan control.\\nTreatment for clinically isolated syndrome\\nTreatment with a disease-modif ying therapy (DMT) may delay or prevent a second \\nneurologic episode and, therefore, the onset of MS. In addition, early treatment may \\nminimiz e future disabilit y caused by further inﬂammation and damage to nerve cells, which \\ncan sometimes occur without any noticeable symptoms. If you have CIS, discuss starting a \\nDMT with your healthcare provider if both things are true:\\n1. You have had one event of MS-lik e symptoms\\n2. You have two or more brain lesions on an MRI scan\\nYou and your healthcare provider can take into account your speciﬁc risks and beneﬁts and \\ndecide whether or not you should start a DMT.\\n5', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANAGING RELAPSES\\nAn exacerbation of MS (also known as a relapse, attack or ﬂare-up) is the occurrence of new \\nsymptoms or the worsening of old symptoms. It can be very mild, or severe enough to \\ninterfere with a person’ s ability to function. No two exacerbations are alike.  Symptoms vary \\nfrom person to person and from one exacerbation to another . For example, the exacerbation \\nmight be an episode of optic neuritis (caused by inﬂammation of the optic nerve that impairs \\nvision), or problems with balance or severe fatigue. Some relapses produce only one \\nsymptom (related to inﬂammation in a single area of the central nervous system). Other \\nrelapses cause two or more symptoms at the same time (related to inﬂammation in more \\nthan one area of the central nervous system). To be a true exacerbation, the attack must last \\nat least 24 hours and be separ ated from the previous attack by at least 30 days. It must also \\noccur in the absence of infection, or other cause. Most exacerbations last from a few days to \\nseveral weeks or even months.\\nWhat causes exacerbations?\\nExacerbations (relapses) are caused by inﬂammation in the central nervous system (CNS). \\nThe inﬂammation damages the myelin, slowing or disrupting the transmission of nerve \\nimpulses and causing the symptoms of MS. In the most common disease course in MS-called \\nrelapsing-remitting MS-clearly deﬁned acute exacerbations are followed by remissions as \\nthe inﬂammatory process gradually comes to an end. Going into remission doesn’ t \\nnecessarily mean that the symptoms disappear totally -some people will return to feeling \\nexactly as they did before the exacerbation began, while others may ﬁnd themselv es left \\nwith some ongoing symptoms.\\nTreating exacerbations\\nThe good news is that not all exacerbations require treatment. Mild sensory changes \\n(numbness, pins-and-needle sensations) or bursts of fatigue that don’t signiﬁcantly impact a \\nperson’ s activities can gener ally be left to get better on their own.\\nFor severe exacerbations (involving loss of vision, severe weakness or poor balance, for \\nexample) which interfere with a person’ s mobilit y, safety or overall ability to function, most \\nneurologists recommend a short course of high-dose corticosteroids to reduce the \\ninﬂammation and bring the relapse to an end more quickly . The most common treatment \\nregimen is a three or ﬁve-day course of intravenous (Solu-Medrol-meth ylprednisolone) or \\noral (Deltasone-prednisone) corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are not believ ed to have any \\nlong-term beneﬁt on the disease.\\n6', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

To \\ndate, the Food and Drug Administr ation of USA (FDA) has appro ved more than a dozen DMTs \\nfor different types of MS. \\nMost recently , the FDA has appro ved:\\nl Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus)  It treats relapsing forms of MS and primary progressiv e MS \\n(PPMS). It's the ﬁrst DMT Trusted Source to be appro ved to treat PPMS and the only one \\nappro ved for all four types of MS.\\nl  Fingolimod (Gilenya)  It treats pediatric MS.

Experiments \\nand trials were on. At that stage, with our children \\ngrowing up, important decisions had to be made \\nregarding their future. Another significant factor was the \\ncost of the therapy. Medicines were exorbitant.  Few \\npharmaceutical companies were making DMTs in those \\ndays.  These were meant to be taken over a longer \\nperiod. \\nThis by no means discredits or undermines the impact of \\nthis disease in other people. I do understand and \\nappreciate how many of us are dependent on external \\nfactors to run our lives.

This was both mentally and \\nphysically straining situation, adding to the challenges to my overall day to day life and \\nresponsibilities. So, the decision was made. We would wait. I am not disrespecting research \\nor telling the others not to take a DMT.

A problem with \\nvision is one of the most common symptoms of MS, and often one of the first that people \\nwith MS notice. The symptoms can include blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), optic \\nneuritis, involuntary rapid eye movement and occasionally , a total loss of sight.\\nProblems with vision can result from damage to the optic nerve or from a lack of \\ncoordination in the eye muscles. The optic nerve connects the eye to the brain. \\nInflammation or demyelination in the optic nerve causes optic neuritis, which is \\nexperienced as a tempor ary loss or disturbance in vision and possibly pain behind the \\naffected eye.\\nTypically , vision returns partially or fully within a few weeks. While it is quite rare for a \\nperson with MS to become totally blind, it is not at all uncommon for an individual to have \\nrecurrent episodes of optic neuritis over the course of the disease, usually in one eye at a \\ntime. Damage to the optic nerve can result in a blurring of vision, which may or may not \\ntotally resolv e over time. Colour vision requires a great many nerve fibres from the eye for \\naccur ate transmission and is particularly susceptible to changes from demyelination.\\nJerkiness\\nOptic neuritis can cause a large, noticeable \"blind spot\" in the centre of the visual field, and \\nthe person experiences a visual image with a dark, blank area in the middle. This is called a \\ncentral scotoma and is not correctable with either eyeglasses or medication, although \\nsteroids may be helpful in the early, acute phase.\\nDiplopia (double vision), the experience of seeing two of everything, is caused by \\nweakening or in coordination of eye muscles. This symptom is typically treated with a short \\ncourse of steroids. Patching one eye while trying to drive or read will stop the double \\nimage; howev er, permanent patching of the eye will slow the brain\\'s remarkable ability to \\naccommodate to the weakness and produce a single image in spite of the weakened \\nmuscles. Some physicians are prescribing eyeglasses with special prisms that help to \\nminimise double vision.\\nUpon examination, the physician may detect a rhythmic jerkiness or bounce in one or both \\neyes.

Damage to both white matter and gray matter \\nstructures are linked to cognitiv e impairment. Damage to specific brain regions can produce \\ndifficult y with specific cognitiv e skills.\\n4. Why is it normal to experience brain atrophy or loss of brain volume as we age? \\nIs there anything that can be done to slow the rate of brain atrophy in people with \\nMS?\\nThe rate of brain atroph y, or shrinkage, in people with MS has been shown to be several times \\nSource than the rate of brain atroph y in people of similar ages who don\\'t have MS. This is \\nbecause MS causes the destruction of axons as well as damage to the brain\\'s white and gray \\nmatter . People with MS who smok e tobacco have been reported Trusted Source to have more \\nbrain atroph y than nonsmok ers. Some studies have reported Trusted Source that certain \\nDMTs may reduce the rate of brain atroph y.

How often should people with MS be screened for signs of cognitive \\nchange?\\nThere are short tests of specific cognitiv e functions that can be easily and quickly \\nadministered in a doctor\\'s office. These can help screen for evidence of cognitiv e impairment. \\nFor example, one such test is called the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).\\nIf a screening test suggests cognitiv e problems, your doctor may recommend a more in-\\ndepth assessment. This would usually be formally done with tests that are collectiv ely \\nreferred to as neuropsy chological testing. It\\'s recommended that people with MS be \\nassessed for cognitiv e function at least once per year.\\n8. How are cognitive symptoms of MS treated?\\nWhen addressing cognitiv e impairment in people with MS, it\\'s important to identif y any \\ncontributing factors, such as fatigue or depression, that may worsen cognitiv e problems.\\nPeople living with MS may have untreated sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. This can also \\naffect cognition. When these secondary factors are treated, cognitiv e function often \\nimpro ves.\\nResearch has shown that targeted cognitiv e rehabilitation strategies are beneficial. These \\nstrategies address specific domains-such as attention, multitasking, processing speed, or \\nmemory - using techniques such as computer training.\\n9. Are there any lifestyle approaches, such as diet and exercise, that may help \\npeople living with MS to reduce or limit cognitive changes?\\nA growing body of literature suggests that regular physical exercise may impro ve cognitiv e \\nfunction in people with MS.\\nWhile no diet has been shown to affect cognition in people with MS per se, a heart-health y \\ndiet ma y reduce the risk of comorbidities (other diseases) that can contribute to cognitiv e \\nimpairment.\\nA heart-health y diet is gener ally one that primarily contains lots of fruits and vegetables, lean \\nproteins, and \"good\" fats such as olive oil. The diet should also limit saturated fats and \\nrefined sugars.\\nFollowing this t ype of eating plan ma y limit comorbidities such as v ascular disease, t ype 2 \\ndiabetes, or high blood pressure.

Although there is no cure for MS, there is hope that one can renew and refresh along \\nthe way, and create a balance in life that promotes harmon y.\\nDeciding to adhere to a health y lifestyle or to maintain health y habits is a choice for each \\nperson. This concept of choice is especially relevant for people with MS who often feel they \\nhave little control over the disease. Diet, exercise, stress management, travel, leisure \\nactivities and health promotion activities are all aspects of living well that are, to a certain \\nextent, under the control of the individual. \\nAlthough there are no particular diets that have been shown to affect the disease process in \\nMS, food fuels the body, and provides energy . A well balanced nutrition plan, low in fat, high \\nin fibre, can help stabilise weight and impro ve bowel health. Adding dietary supplements \\nsuch as multi- vitamins with miner als, calcium, and vitamin D should not replace proper food \\nintake, but can be useful. People with MS should be encour aged to check with their doctor or \\nnurse before taking vitamins, miner als, or herbal supplements to ensure safety and \\ncompatibilit y with the traditional medications already prescribed. \\nRegular exercise is important for several reasons, and should be part of everyone's routine. \\nExercise not only impro ves cardio vascular health, but also helps impro ve strength and \\nendur ance, and is a factor in stabilising mood.

MS is a \\ndisease of the brain and spinal cord that can cause symptoms such as vision changes, balance \\nproblems, and weakness.\\n“Honestly , I was a hot mess, ” she says. “By the time I went, I had numerous symptoms, but I \\nwas in denial about the fatigue, numbness, and increasing mobilit y concerns. Then, even when I \\nhad an answer about what was going on, I refused to accept the devastation of it.”\\nAfter her doctor said, “You have MS,” Warren realiz ed, she didn’t hear anything that followed. \\nThat’s true as well for Johnnah Rosano , a 39-year-old Boston resident who says it felt as if her \\nbrain shut off as soon as that diagnosis was made. Because this is a life-changing condition, \\nbeing able to adjust to the news takes time— and it would be beneficial to have one appointment \\nthat’s simply about getting the diagnosis and doesn’ t also include all the possible treatment \\noptions, Warren suggests.\\n“I think it’s helpful for doctors to know that this is devastating, ” she says. “This disease will affect \\nyour whole life, and that means you have to adjust mentally , which takes time.”\\nTake Time To Explain Tests And Imaging\\nWith MS, there are so many tests that it can be dizzying to understand the purpose of each one, \\nmuch less what those tests are supposed to convey, says Vickie Hadge, a 56-year-old \\nConnecticut resident.\\nAlthough patients may have access to results in their patient portals, it can be confusing to \\nnavigate through terms like white matter hyperintensities and to understand why 10 vials of \\nblood are needed.\\n“Even if you had a printout of what each test is supposed to show, that would help, because this \\ndisease often feels overwhelming, ” Hadge says. “Clarit y and understanding can reduce  that \\nfeeling, and that’s a big advantage. ”\\nMake it a habit to tell people ‘thank you’.

For example, a functional evaluation often takes about \\nthree hours, and Hadge went into her first one with no idea why she was going, what would \\nhappen during the appointment, and how the results might affect her treatment. That lack of \\nprepar ation can cause stress and anxiet y, she says, potentially worsening MS symptoms and \\nleaving patients feeling helpless.\\nGrief counseling is a helpful addition to treatment\\nMental health is a major component of dealing with MS , and while seeing a ther apist is often \\nhelpful, focusing on grief specifically makes a strong starting point, believ es Brittan y Quiroz, 33, \\nwho lives in Corona, Calif.\\nAfter all, MS diagnosis and progression can involve feeling loss, in terms of both physical \\nfunction and potential future plans, as well as cognitiv e challenges. Being able to find peace \\nwithin the condition would be hugely valuable for disease management, Quiroz suggests.\\n“Managing illness like this is a full-time job, and having emotional support should be part of \\ntreatment, ” she says. “If doctors could have those resources available in advance, so they could \\nshare them immediately , that would go a long way toward dealing with the stress of having MS.”\\nUnderstanding our frustr ations helps us feel heard\\nMuch like a condition like lupus, MS can take years to diagnose after symptoms begin, and those \\nsymptoms can change over time-sometimes even from month to month. That’s already \\nstressful, but if you feel unheard at a doctor ’s appointment, it’s so much worse, says Sonda \\nRossman, a 51-year-old Detroit resident.\\n“There are many symptoms that are invisible, like cognitiv e impairment, fatigue, and sensory \\nissues, ” she says. “These don’t show up on lab or imaging tests, so I believ e doctors need to rely \\na little less on what the results say and a little more on what patients are saying. Don’t tell me \\nI’m OK because that’s what the MRI says. I know my body, and I know when it’s not OK.”\\nAnother frustr ation may be a lack of coordination among specialists, adds Rosano . For instance, \\nshe began experiencing high blood pressure, and her neurologist suggested anxiet y medication \\nbecause “people with MS don’t have high blood pressure. ” But she didn’t feel anxious, so she \\nasked to see a cardiologist. He told her it’s common to see blood-pressure issues in those with \\nMS, and prescribed medication that addressed the problem.\\n“This is just one example of how we often have to talk to one doctor after another , because for \\nmany of us, there’ s no point person looking at the whole picture, ” Rosano says. “So on top of \\nbeing sick with a disease that usually includes fatigue, we have to be our own health advocates. \\nIt’s exhausting, and it can lead people to be reluctant to talk about their symptoms, which is \\nobviously not ideal. ”We want to discuss nutrition and other lifestyle changes Nutrition is   \\nnotoriously understudied in medical schools, says Warren, who had to educate herself on the \\ntopic, both before her MS diagnosis and afterw ard.

       " Document(page_content='NEUROGENIC PAIN IN MS\\nClaudio Solaro , MD, Department of Neurology , ASL 3 Hospitals, Genoa, Italy.\\nIntroduction Pain is defined as an \"unpleasant sensory experience associated with actual or \\npotential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\". Although symptom \\nmanagement in MS represents a primary focus for health care professionals, data available \\nin the liter ature on pain management is lacking. Neurogenic pain common in MS includes \\ndysesthetic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, painful tonic spasms and Lhermitte\\'s sign. Ethical \\nissues regarding studies on pain mak e it difficult to identif y the best treatment str ategies \\nbased on comparisons of medication versus a placebo . Thus, for many of these symptoms \\ntreatment is based on anecdotal information and small, unblinded trials. Dysesthetic pain A \\nnumber of studies have reported dysesthetic pain to be among the most common pain \\nsyndromes associated with MS. \\nDysesthetic pain is described as a constant symmetric or asymmetric burning sensation, \\nusually affecting a person\\'s lower limbs, more frequently distally (meaning farther away \\nfrom the body, such as in the feet and lower legs) than proximally (meaning closer to the \\nbody, such as in the upper part of the legs). A degree of sensory loss associated with \\ndysesthetic pain can be detected during a neurological examination. First-line medications \\nfor the treatment of dysesthetic pain in MS are tricyclic antidepressants, including \\namitript yline, nortript yline and clomipr amine. \\nAnticon vulsant medications such as carbamaz epine, lamotrigine and gabapentin are also \\nused in treating dysesthetic pain associated with MS. Carbamaz epine appears to have a \\nhigher incidence of side effects, when compared to gabapentin and lamotrigine. Some \\npeople have difficult y tolerating this medication due to its side effects, and are not able to \\neven reach the dose necessary for the mediation to be effectiv e. It is not uncommon for a \\nperson to try different medications before finding one that is effectiv e and tolerable.\\nOpen communication with the neurologist is very important throughout this process. In \\ngener al, anticon vulsant medications, as well as tricyclic antidepressants, may be useful in \\nsome MS patients, although unfortunately there is not enough data available from studies \\nwith large numbers of participants, which is necessary for drawing conclusions as to the best \\nchoice of medication. \\n42', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 46}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Trigeminal neuralgia :\\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is probably the most widely recognised neurogenic pain \\nsyndrome in MS. It affects the trigeminal nerve, one of the largest nerves in the head (see \\nabove). The trigeminal nerve sends impulses of touch, pain, pressure and temper ature to \\nthe brain from the face, jaw, gums, forehead and around the eyes. TN in people with MS \\nhas been widely studied, with prevalence ranging from 1.9 percent to 4.4 percent. \\nTN is characterised by paroxysmal (sudden), episodic facial pain which occurs in the area \\nof the fifth cranial or trigeminus nerve, often triggered by touch, chewing, shaving or even \\na light breez e. TN in MS and essential TN (TN not related to MS) differ in that TN in MS is \\nmore often bilater al The trigeminal nerv e and its br anches T rigeminal nerv e  (occurs on \\nboth sides of the face) and tends to occur at a younger age. \\nEssentially TN is most frequently caused by a blood vessel pressing on the nerve near the \\nbrain stem. Over time, changes in the blood vessels of the brain can result in a blood vessel \\nrubbing against the trigeminal nerve root. The constant rubbing with each heartbeat \\nwears away the insulating membr ane of the nerve, resulting in nerve irritation. TN in MS is \\nlikely to be caused by a plaque at the \\nTN nerve entry zone in the nerve fibres \\non the lower front surface of the brain. \\nHowev er, magnetic resonance imaging \\n(MRI) studies have demonstr ated \\nconflicting results, pointing to multiple \\ncauses of TN, even in the same person \\nwith MS. Treatment of TN primarily \\nconsists of anticonvulsant \\nmedications. Some antidepressant \\ndrugs can also be helpful in relieving \\nthis type of pain. Non-pharmacological \\ninterv entions for trigeminal neuralgia \\nWhen medications are ineffectiv e or if they produce undesir able side effects, neurosurgical \\nprocedures are available to reliev e pressure on the nerve, to reduce nerve sensitivit y or to \\ninterrupt the nerve pathway. These procedures have been reported as treatment for TN \\nassociated with MS, although with small numbers of people and limited follow -up. These \\ntechniques can cause nerve damage which may lead to increased sensitivit y or numbness \\nin the affected area, decreased corneal reflex, tempor ary difficult y chewing and hearing \\nloss.\\nPainful tonic spasms :\\n Painful tonic spasms (PTS) are described as a cramping, pulling pain and can affect both \\nthe upper and lower limbs, although they are more common in the lower extremities. The \\nspasms are triggered by movements or sensory stimuli, often occurring during the night. \\nPTS are estimated to occur in appro ximately 11 percent of people with MS. PTS indirectly \\nresult from a lesion triggering the painful spasms in the central nervous system. \\nAntispasticit y medications, such as baclofen and benzodiazepines, gabapentin and \\ntiagabine, are largely used for the treatment of PTS.\\n43', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",

If the phenomenon becomes \\npersistent, small doses of carbamaz epine \\nhave been recommended for reducing the \\nfrequency and severity.

       " Document(page_content='MAKING NUTRITIONAL CHOICES\\nBy Dr Anne Payne, Lecturer in Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, Glasgow Caledonian \\nUniversity, Glasgow , United Kingdom  \\n  We know that our health and happiness are intricately bound up in our choice of food and \\ndrink. We also know we gain a sense of well-being from taking control of our diets. It\\'s not \\nsurprising that people with MS so frequently ask:\\n \"What type of food should I eat to stay health y?\" \\nThe simple answer – \"a low animal-fat diet\" – is true of relapsing-remitting MS and is good \\nadvice. Howev er, the real answer is actually quite complex as individual needs in MS are as \\nvaried and unpredictable as the symptoms of MS themselv es. In the beginning When MS is \\nfirst diagnosed, most people are able to eat a varied diet. This is a good time to encour age \\nthe principles of a health y-eating regimen, outlined in Table 1, as most people with MS are \\nmotiv ated to make positiv e changes. \\nThose who have had MS for some time will be familiar with the concept of a health y diet, \\nlow in animal fats such as butter and fatty meat, but rich in vegetable fats and oily fish. This \\ntype of diet has been advised by MS societies world- wide for many years. The evidence in \\nsupport of this type of diet suggests that omega-3 oils found in oily fish such as mack erel, \\nsardines, herring and tuna may have an anti-inflammatory role in many conditions, \\nincluding MS. Linoleic acid, a type of omega-6 polyunsatur ated fat found in some vegetable \\noils, has been described as a treatment which may help slow down the disabling effects of \\nMS. \\nHealth professionals are not unanimous about this, but there is no doubt that linoleic acid is \\na valuable part of a health y diet. Howev er, the daily recommended amount can be obtained \\nthrough a balanced diet and there is no need for capsules if the diet is adequate. More than \\nthe recommended dose does not increase the potential benefits. As many people with MS \\nare minimally active, with low energy needs, the lower amounts of linoleic acid they need \\nare best taken from concentr ated omega-6 oils, such as sunflower oil, safflower oil or soya \\noil. These oils are also a rich source of vitamin E. This is thought to protect myelin and other \\ntissues from oxidativ e damage. Vitamin E is found in abundance in wholegr ain cereals as \\nwell.\\n51', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",

Early warning Change in body weight and \\nnutritional well-being in MS usually occurs slowly and so the onset of debilitating weight \\ngain or malnutrition is often ill defined and a pattern of poor eating habits has become well-\\nestablished by the time any action is taken.  \\nThis can be prevented by ensuring that weight and height are recorded at diagnosis and \\nthat weight is recorded at each clinic visit thereafter to enable a nurse, nutritionist or \\ndietician to monitor \"body mass index\" (BMI), a measure of weight for height. \\nPoor mobilit y Constipation, weight gain and UTIs often occur simultaneously in those with \\nMS who use a wheelchair , due to limited mobilit y. Their diet should include a fair amount of \\nbulky, low fat, high fibre foods, including soft fruits such as bananas, prunes and peaches, a \\ngood selection of vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a daily intake of two litres or more of \\nsugar -free fluids. Cranberry juice is popular in the prevention of UTI. Howev er, cranberry \\ndrinks contain a lot of sugar so they should be used with caution. Cranberry capsules are an \\nalternativ e to juice.\\nModify with care:  At no time is choice of diet of greater importance in MS than when the \\nability to sw allow food or fluid is affected. Dysphagia, as this is known, causes coughing \\nand choking during meals and commonly results in poor intake. This can lead to severe \\nweight loss, possible dehydration, and to pneumonia if food particles are aspirated during \\ncoughing or choking. The diet should be modified with care. To prepare soft but nourishing \\nfood, it may be necessary to finely mash chopped fish or meat into thick sauce or gravy with \\na fork. If a purée diet is advised by a health professional trained to assess swallowing \\nability, then a food blender may be needed. Sometimes drinks are taken more easily when \\nthickened a little with a special food starch. Thickening can help prevent a trickle of fluid \\nfrom entering the lungs. When malnutrition is a problem Other symptoms of MS can also \\ncontribute to malnutrition and should be identified early. \\nSevere tremor and postur al difficulties may make eating physically difficult to accomplish. \\nTremor may also increase energy and nutrient needs. Many adaptiv e aids are available that \\ncan assist people who experience physical difficulties while eating or drinking. These \\ninclude plates with rims and nonslip surfaces, special grip cutlery , weighted utensils, \\ndrinking cups with handles, special grip surfaces or weights and many others. Poor vision \\naffects the ability to shop, prepare meals and to eat. \\nOnline shopping using an adapted computer screen can be helpful for some people with \\nvisual difficulties. An occupational therapist can provide suggestions for adapting meal \\nprepar ations and eating. Fatigue and poor appetite cause weight loss as small, less \\nfrequent meals are tak en. Fatigue can be especially problematic for people with MS who \\nhave the responsibilit y for meal prepar ation in the home.\\n52', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",

Most of us don't ha ve ﬁve minutes to sit down and relax, let alone 30 minutes or \\nmore for a meditation session. But it is essential for our wellbeing to take a few minutes each \\nday to cultiv ate mental spaciousness and achiev e a positiv e mind-body balance. So if you are \\na busy bee like me, you can use these simple mindfulness exercises to empty your mind and \\nﬁnd some much-needed calm amidst the madness of your hectic day. I'm going to cover 6 \\nexercises that take very little effort and can be done pretty much anywhere at anytime:\\n1. Mindful Breathing\\nThis exercise can be done standing up or sitting down, and pretty much anywhere at any \\ntime. If you can sit down in the meditation (lotus) position, that's great, if not, no worries. \\nEither way, all you have to do is be still and focus on your breath for just one minute.\\nl  Start by breathing in and out slowly . One breath cy cle should last for appro ximately 6 \\nseconds.\\nl  Breathe in through y our nose and out through y our mouth, letting y our breath ﬂow \\neffortlessly in and out of y our body .\\nl  Let go of your thoughts. Let go of things you have to do later today or pending projects that \\nneed y our attention. Simply let thoughts rise and fall of their own accord and be at one \\nwith your breath.\\nl  Purposefully watch your breath, focusing your sense of awareness on its pathway as it \\nenters your body and ﬁlls you with life.\\nl  Then watch with your awareness as it works work its way up and out of your mouth and its \\nenergy dissipates into the world.\\nIf you are someone who thought they'd never be able to meditate, guess what? You are half \\nway there already!\\nIf you enjoyed one minute of this mind-calming exercise, why not try two or three?\\n2. Mindful Observation\\nThis exercise is simple but incredibly powerful because it helps you notice and appreciate \\nseemingly simple elements of your environment in a more profound way.\\nThe exercise is designed to connect us with the beaut y of the natur al environment, \\nsomething that is easily missed when we are rushing around in the car or hopping on and off \\ntrains on the way to work.l  Mindful breathing\\nl  Mindful observ ation\\nl  Mindful a wareness\\nl  Mindful listening\\nl  Mindful immersion\\nl  Mindful appreciation\\n56\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='l  Choose a natur al object from within your immediate environment and focus on watching it \\nfor a minute or two. This could be a ﬂower or an insect, or even the clouds or the moon.\\nl  Don\\'t do anything except notice the thing you are looking at. Simply relax into watching for \\nas long as your concentr ation allows.\\nl  Look at this object as if you are seeing it for the ﬁrst time.\\nl  Visually explore every aspect of its formation, and allow yourself to be consumed by its \\npresence.\\nl  Allow yourself to connect with its energy and its purpose within the natur al world.\\n3. Mindful Awareness\\nThis exercise is designed to cultiv ate a heightened awareness and appreciation of simple \\ndaily tasks and the results they achiev e. Think of something that happens every day more \\nthan once; something you take for granted, like opening a door, for example. At the very \\nmoment you touch the doorknob to open the door, stop for a moment and be mindful of \\nwhere you are, how you feel in that moment and where the door will lead you.\\nSimilarly , the moment you open your computer to start work, take a moment to appreciate \\nthe hands that enable this process and the brain that facilitates your understanding of how to \\nuse the computer . \\nThese \\'touch point\\' cues don\\'t have to be physical ones.\\nFor example: Each time you think a negativ e thought, you might choose to take a moment to \\nstop, label the thought as unhelpful and release the negativit y. Or, perhaps each time y ou \\nsmell food, you take a moment to stop and appreciate how lucky you are to have good food to \\neat and share with your family and friends. Choose a touch point that resonates with you \\ntoday and, instead of going through your daily motions on autopilot, take occasional \\nmoments to stop and cultiv ate purposeful awareness of what you are doing and the blessings \\nthese actions brings to your life.\\n4. Mindful Listening\\nThis exercise is designed to open your ears to sound in a non-judgmental way, and indeed to \\ntrain your mind to be less swayed by the inﬂuence of past experiences and preconception.\\nSo much of what we \"feel\" is inﬂuenced by past experience. For example, we may dislike a \\nsong because it reminds us of a breakup or another period of life when things felt negativ e.\\nSo the idea of this exercise is to listen to some music from a neutr al standpoint, with a \\npresent awareness that is unhindered by preconception.\\nSelect a piece of music you have never heard before. You may have something in your own \\ncollection that you have never listened to, or you might choose to turn the radio dial until \\nsomething catches your ear.\\nl  Close your eyes and put on your headphones.\\nl  Try not to get drawn into judging the music by its genre, title or artist name before it has \\nbegun. Instead, ignore any labels and neutr ally allow yourself to get lost in the journey of \\nsound for the duration of the song.\\nl  Allow yourself to explore every aspect of track. Even if the music isn\\'t to your liking at ﬁrst, \\nlet go of your dislike and give your awareness full permission to climb inside the track and \\ndance among the sound waves.\\nl  Explore the song by listening to the dynamics of each instrument. Separ ate each sound in \\nyour mind and analyz e each one by one.\\nl  Hone in on the vocals: the sound of the voice, its range and tones. If there is more than one \\nvoice, separ ate them out as you did in step 4.\\nThe idea is to listen intently , to become fully entwined with the composition without \\npreconception or judgment of the genre, artist, lyrics or instrumentation. Don\\'t think, hear.\\n57', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"5. Mindful Immersion\\nThe intention of this exercise is to cultiv ate contentment in the moment and escape the \\npersistent striving we ﬁnd ourselv es caught up in on a daily basis. Rather than anxiously \\nwanting to ﬁnish an everyday routine task in order to get on with doing something else, take \\nthat regular routine and fully experience it like never before. For example: if you are cleaning \\nyour house, pay attention to every detail of the activit y. Rather than treat this as a regular \\nchore, create an entirely new experience by noticing every aspect of your actions:\\nFeel and become the motion when sweeping the ﬂoor, sense the muscles you use when \\nscrubbing the dishes, develop a more efﬁcient way of wiping the windows clean. The idea is \\nto get creativ e and discover new experiences within a familiar routine task. Instead of \\nlabouring through and constantly thinking about ﬁnishing the task, become aware of every \\nstep and fully immerse yourself in the progress. Take the activit y beyond a routine by \\naligning yourself with it physically , mentally and spiritually .\\nWho knows, you might even enjoy the cleaning for once!\\n6. Mindful Appreciation\\nIn this last exercise, all you have to do is notice 5 things in your day that usually go \\nunappreciated. These things can be objects or people; it's up to you. Use a notepad to check \\noff 5 by the end of the day. The point of this exercise is to simply give thanks and appreciate \\nthe seemingly insigniﬁcant things in life, the things that support our existence but rarely get \\na second thought amidst our desire for bigger and better things.\\nFor example: electricit y powers your kettle, the postman delivers your mail, your clothes \\nprovide you warmth, your nose lets you smell the ﬂowers in the park, your ears let you hear \\nthe birds in the tree by the bus stop, but…\\nl\\x00Do you know how these things/processes came to exist, or how they really work?\\nl\\x00Have you ever properly acknowledged how these things beneﬁt your life and the lives of \\nothers?\\nl\\x00Have you ever thought about what life might be like without these things?\\nl\\x00Have you ever stopped to notice their ﬁner, more intricate details?\\nl\\x00Have you ever sat down and thought about the relationships between these things and \\nhow together they play an interconnected role in the functioning of the earth?\\nOnce you have identiﬁed your 5 things, make it your duty to ﬁnd out everything you can \\nabout their creation and purpose to truly appreciate the way in which they support your life.\\nWhy Mindfulness Exercises?\\nThe cultiv ation of moment -by-moment awareness of our surrounding environment is a \\npractice that helps us better cope with the difﬁcult thoughts and feelings that cause us stress \\nand anxiet y in everyday life.\\nWith regular practice of mindfulness exercises, rather than being led on auto-pilot by \\nemotions inﬂuenced by negativ e past experiences and fears of future occurrences, we \\nharness the ability to root the mind in the present moment and deal with life's challenges in a \\nclear-minded, calm, assertiv e way.\\nIn turn, we develop a fully conscious mind-set that frees us from the imprisonment of \\nunhelpful, self-limiting thought patterns, and enables us to be fully present to focus on \\npositiv e emotions that increase compassion and understanding in ourselv es and others.\\n58\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

In addition, a reduction in the amount of brain atroph y (shrinkage) was seen in \\nsome people, particularly in those who receiv ed the largest number of neural stem cells. \\nThis innovative research was supported by our member organisation, the Italian MS \\nSociet y. The Chairman of the Italian MS Foundation (FISM), Professor Mario Alberto \\nBattaglia states:\\n“For over twent y years we have promoted and supported stem cell research, investing in \\nbasic research and human trials. Scientific research is a length y process, but it’s the only \\nway to achiev e results that can tangibly change people’ s lives. This is the research we want \\nand the research we fund. Over the past twent y years, a lot has changed in multiple \\nsclerosis, and a lot is being done for the progressiv e forms. People with the most serious \\nforms [of MS] have innovative answers to help them deal with symptoms and have a better \\nqualit y of life, also thanks to rehabilitation. We will continue to develop this stem cell \\nresearch as well as other innovative projects to continue towards a world without multiple \\nsclerosis. ”\\nIn India it could cost from Rs 5 lakh to 15 lakhs.\\nAlthough these results are very promising, they need to be confirmed in a larger group of \\npatients before this type of therapy could be used in routine clinical practice. The next step \\nwill be to develop new clinical trials that involve broader groups of patients. These trials will \\nneed to prove that the treatment can stop the progression of the disease as well as showing \\nthe ability of neural stem cells to regener ate damaged areas of the nervous system .\\nl  Impro ved Balance.\\nl  Heightened Vision.\\nl  Enhanced Motor Functions.\\nl  Significantly better sensitivit y.\\nl  Lesser occurrences of tremor .\\nl  Lowered neuropathic pain.\\nl  Diminished spasticit y.\\nl  Lesser tiredness.\\n63', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",

Introduction\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive debilitating and heteroge-\\nneous nervous system disease characterized by demyelination due to\\na misguided atypical immune response within the body. It is the most\\ncommon neurological disorder affecting mainly central nervous system\\n(CNS) of the body ( Berer and Krishnamoorthy, 2014 ). Several endoge-\\nnous factors like genetic elements and exogenous components likeenvironmental elements are believed to be responsible for causing the\\ndisease ( Fig. 1 )(Sadovnick et al., 1996; Simon et al., 2011; Sawcer\\net al., 2014 ). As a result, it is supposed to be an outcome of complex in-\\nteractions between these components ( Ramagopalan et al., 2010 ). Ear-\\nlier it was believed to be widespread in several parts of Europe andUnited States only ( Compston and Coles, 2008 ); but, as time has\\nelapsed, it has become a global problem ( Atlas of MS, 2013 ). It is the dis-\\nease whose prevalence has signi ﬁcantly changed over the time\\n(Pugliatti et al., 2006; Benito-León and Bermejo-Pareja, 2010 ). There\\nhave been several amendments in the diagnostic criteria for its im-proved diagnosis and effective management ( Polman et al., 2011 ). Ex-\\ntensive research has resulted in better understanding of MS pattern indifferent parts of the world, with few exceptions ( Zahoor et al., 2017b ).\\nAs of now, there are suf ﬁcient lines of evidence to suggest that MS', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n",

Ac-\\ncording to the latest reports, MS prevalence has increased worldwide\\n(Rosati, 2001; Atlas of MS, 2013 ) and the latest survey carried out by\\nthe Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF) and WorldHealth Organisation (WHO) in the year 2013 has pointed towards a\\nglobal increase in the number of people with MS from 2.1 million in\\n2008 to 2.3 million in 2013 along with increase in global median preva-\\nlence from 30 per 100,000 in 2008 to 33 per 100,000 in 2013 ( Atlas of\\nMS, 2008; Atlas of MS, 2013 ). This has changed MS scenario in the re-\\ngions which were once considered as low/no risk zones for MS especial-\\nly Asian countries like India ( Zahoor et al., 2017a; Zahoor et al., 2017b ).\\nA comparison of MS prevalence between some Asian countries during2013 has been made with help of data available from Atlas of MS,\\n2013 ,r eﬂecting highest prevalence rate for Cyprus ( Fig. 2 ). In this re-\\ngard, this review article emphasizes the changing prevalence of MS in\\nIndia and provides insights garnered from the published studies with\\nmain focus on understanding the real picture of the disease in India,with an attempt of providing basis for future epidemiological studiesacross the country.\\n2. MS prevalence in India: An update\\nIndia is a vast developing South Asian country with enormous diversi-\\nty in terms of physical features, culture, religion, caste, language, and race.\\nThe existence of racial diversity in the Indian sub-continent is due to the\\npresence of a large number of races from diverse backgrounds who\\nhave migrated over the Himalayas. This has given rise to the dispersion\\nof these races across India and therefore diversi ﬁcation of the population.\\nThis feature makes India a prospective target for exploring epidemiologyof heterogeneous diseases like MS. MS was ﬁrst described in India during\\n1954 –1961 by Singh ( Singh et al., 1954 ), Ramamurthy ( Ramamurthy,\\n1957 ), and Bharucha ( Bharucha and Umarji, 1961 ). The ﬁrst attempt to\\nestimate the prevalence rate of MS across India was made by Singhal dur-ing 1975– 1985 in the west coast area and on the basis of hospital data, it\\nwas approximated to be 0.17 to 1.33 per 100,000 ( Singhal, 1985 ). Initially\\nduring the period of mid-seventies, MS was believed to be rare in India\\n(Kurtzke, 1985 ); however, with increased availability of neurologists, re-\\nvisions in existing diagnostic criteria, increased disease awareness and ad-vancement in diagnostic tools; it is being increasingly diagnosed in India\\n(Syal et al., 1999; Sarma and Nagaraj, 2005; Pandit and Shetty, 2007;\\nGupta et al., 2013). Most of the studies on MS in India have been conduct-ed in South Indian regions especially Maharashtra (Bombay now Mumbai\\nand Poona now Pune) and Karnataka (Mangalore) in a community-based\\nset up ( Singhal, 1985; Bharucha et al., 1988; Wadia and Bhatia, 1990;\\nPandit and Kundapur, 2014; Jena et al., 2015 ) .T h e r eh a v eb e e nv e r yl i m -\\nited studies in North India ( Bhatia et al., 1996; Singhal et al., 2015; Zahoor\\net al., 2017a; Zahoor et al., 2017b). During the period of late eighties andearly nineties, two small scale door-to-door surveys and community-\\nbased studies were conducted by Bharucha et al. and Wadia and Bhatia\\nin Maharashtra to study the prevalence of MS among Parsi population\\ninhabiting the regions of Mumbai and Pune ( Bharucha et al., 1988;\\nWadia and Bhatia, 1990 ). They reported prevalence of 21 to 26 per\\n100,000 ( Bharucha et al., 1988; Wadia and Bhatia, 1990 ) for Parsis from\\nMumbai and 58 per 100,000 ( Wadia and Bhatia, 1990 ) for those from\\nPune. The Parsi population also known as Zoroastrians is believed tohave migrated to India from the Pars province of Iran and settled along\\nFig. 1.

This clearly re ﬂects the presence of some speciﬁ ce l e m e n t s\\nof predisposition in the community and therefore poses a higher disease\\nrisk in them.\\nRecently, in a survey conducted by Pandit and Kundapur from\\nJanuary 2011 to July 2013, the prevalence and patterns of different de-\\nmyelinating disorders of CNS in urban Mangalore of South India were\\nstudied using registry method ( Pandit and Kundapur, 2014 ). The pre-\\nliminary data revealed a crude prevalence of 8.3 per 100,000 for MS,which was much higher than the previous studies carried out on any\\nIndian population except for Parsi community ( Fig. 3 )(Singhal, 1985;\\nBharucha et al., 1988; Wadia and Bhatia, 1990 ). This estimate was\\nfound to be in line with the latest ﬁgures of 2013 Atlas of MS as reported\\nby MSIF and WHO ( Atlas of MS, 2013 ), reﬂecting a switch for India from\\nlow MS risk zone to modest in last thirty years; however, it is likely that\\nthese estimates for prevalence are underestimate and far from the actu-\\nal rates which can be probably much higher. Although, there is dearth of\\ndata on MS pro ﬁle from northern most part of India ( Zahoor et al.,\\n2017b ); our newly published short report ( Zahoor et al., 2017a )b a s e d\\non single-hospital setting clearly re ﬂects change in MS scenario in Kash-\\nmir valley of India, as earlier no case of MS was detected ( Razdan et al.,\\n1994 ) and now it is being diagnosed growingly by the neurologists in\\nKashmir ( Zahoor et al., 2017b ). The comparison between some critical\\nstudies on MS prevalence from India has been made in Table 1 .\\nIn an attempt to unearth the outright cure and cause of this devastat-\\ning disease, epidemiological studies form the bedrock and unfortunatelythe studies done so far in India have certain limitations for the obvious\\nreasons and therefore they don't portray actual MS rates in the Indian\\npopulation. There has been a considerable change in MS prevalence in\\nIndia over the last thirty years and studies based on hospital data have\\nhinted towards an increase in MS admissions across Indian hospitals(Syal et al., 1999; Zahoor et al., 2015; Zahoor et al., 2017b ). This transfor-\\nmation cannot be ignored and is a matter of serious concern for re-searchers, health care professionals, pharma professionals, and above all\\npolicy makers of the country. Even the earlier observations made on MS\\nin India including demographics seem to be changing as revealed by\\nsome latest studies in which female predominance has been reported\\n(Jena et al., 2015; Zahoor et al., 2017a ). As a result, the current prevalence\\nﬁgures are mere an approximation as it is likely that MS in India remains\\nunder diagnosed and many patients don't have an easy access to thehealth care system and therefore are not registered anywhere within\\nthe country. By and large, there is low disease awareness in the Indian\\nsociety.\\n3. Challenges\\nMore than 148 years have passed since ﬁr s tr e p o r to nM Sb yC h a r c o t\\n(Charcot, 1868 ); still its true incidence and prevalence rates in several\\nparts of the world including India are not known. Despite widespread\\nresearch on MS, it remains a challenging silent killer for patients, med-\\nical professionals and researchers. In our recently published review\\n(Zahoor et al., 2017b ); we have discussed several challenges in doing\\nMS related research in India. Apart from these, the most important chal-lenges persisting in India are lack of well-planned large-scale epidemio-\\nlogical studies with long-term follow up of patients, inactive\\ncollaboration between clinicians and neuroscientists across different\\nparts of the country and absence of nation-wide MS registry/database.\\nOne of the major limitations is poor maintenance of data on MS across\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 82}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"today, the exact causal factor triggering neurodegeneration in MS pa-\\nthology via an auto-in ﬂammatory response remains obscured. The lead-\\ning challenge in MS is that despite claiming an external trigger to beresponsible for disease development in genetically susceptible or im-\\nmune compromised individuals, it remains complex to identify individ-\\nuals who are at risk of developing the disease. Currently, there is no\\napproach to monitor the future course of disease, thus making it prettyunpredictable.\\nFurthermore, there are no speci ﬁc biomarkers for establishing accu-\\nrate MS diagnosis. There are no reliable prognostic markers to predict\\nperson's response to different treatment options based on his/her geno-\\ntype and at the same time monitor effect on disease relapse and sever-\\nity. Research on effective management of MS is at its peak, however,\\nthere are certain new challenging issues like different approved treat-\\nment options are available only for less severe forms of the disease\\nand there are no speci ﬁc effective drugs for progressive forms\\n(Singhal, 2015 ). MS remains to be a convoluted expensive disease due\\nto its costly treatment approach and in low income countries like\\nIndia there is very limited funding from government to support patients\\nand research ( Zahoor et al., 2017b ). At present there is no treatment op-\\ntion that modulates the immune system in individuals having higherdisease risk due to genetic predisposition or strong family history.\\nThere is no way to treat the disease completely and stop it from taking\\nan ugly turn. Currently, there is a tremendous need to develop individ-\\nualized, safe, affordable, and more effective pharmacotherapy.\\n4. Conclusions\\nIn order to establish actual burden of MS in India, we need to have\\ndata from every corner of the country. This will surely give us an idea\\nwhether MS in India is just a tip of an iceberg or a volcano waiting to\\nerupt. Keeping in view changing prevalence of MS in India, there are\\nhigher chances that the latest ﬁgures can be far from the actual status\\nof MS in India. Accordingly, there are possible chances of disease under-estimation in a populous country like India having a whopping popula-\\ntion of greater than 1.25 billion. Neuroscientists and neurologists should\\nwork on one platform to ﬁght against this chronic disease. Well-\\ndesigned nation-wide population-based studies are needed to get theactual picture of MS in India and at the same time comparison of epide-\\nmiological ﬁgures in different regions of India with rest of the world and\\nAsia. This will surely form the basis for further research on MS in India\\nand eventually aid in proper diagnosis, outright cure and management\\nof this crippling disease. In short, we cannot afford to ignore the growing\\nnumber of MS patients in the country and wait till the disease takes an\\nugly turn in India, engul ﬁng a large chunk of population. Therefore, it's\\nbetter to be late than never.\\nAuthor declaration\\nThe authors declare that they have no con ﬂict of interest related to\\nthis manuscript.

Although \\nhistory of measles and chicken pox was higher in patients with MS than controls, it was statistically not significant. \\nFrom their data set of 63 MS patients they reported that there \\nwere 10 smokers in the MS group, compared to 4 among the \\ncontrols. They also reported that there was a significant higher \\nfamily history of MS and other autoimmune disease among the \\npatients as compared to controls.\\nHigher prevalence of MS is seen in patients with higher \\nsocioeconomic status and better sanitary conditions. In a study, \\n30 patients with probable MS from Mumbai, India were followed \\nup for a period of 15 years. MS was more frequent in patients \\nwith better socioeconomic status in the Parsi community.\\n[18] \\nEpidemiological and experimental data support the role of vitamin D as a potentially important environmental risk factor for \\nMS. A study by Pandit et al. measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin \\nD, i.e., 25(OH)D levels and reported that patients with MS had \\nsignificantly lower 25(OH)D levels than matched controls, and \\npatients in relapse had a significantly lower vitamin D level \\ncompared to those in remission. Vitamin D deficiency was seen \\nin a higher proportion of cases than among controls. Higher \\nquartiles of vitamin D showed an inverse relationship with MS.\\n[25] \\nPrevious studies have shown that United Kingdom (UK)- and \\nNorth America-born children of Asians have higher prevalence of MS, indicating that MS is more common as distance from the equator increases, and that a certain ethnicity may confer \\nsome degree of protection against the increased risk of MS.\\n[27,28]\\nGenetic Susceptibility\\nThe likelihood of an individual developing MS is strongly influenced by her or his ethnic background and family history \\nof disease, suggesting that genetic susceptibility is a key \\ndeterminant of risk. Various human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) \\nthat have been noted to be more common in MS are being studied \\nworldwide, but the role of HLA genes in the Indian population \\nhas not been adequately reported. Only a few studies from India \\nhave identified an immunological and genetic basis for MS.\\nWadia et al. observed that there is a significant relative risk \\nof MS among Indians with the HLA-B12 haplotype. This \\nantigen was detected in 80% of cases, compared with 15% \\nof controls.\\n[14] These preliminary findings seem to point to \\na different immunogenetic profile of Indian MS patients in \\ncomparison with Western and Japanese series.[28] Another study \\nby the same group showed that the lower incidence of MS in India may have genetic implications. HLA-A3 and HLA-B7 \\nhaplotypes were found to be lower among Indians than among \\nCaucasians. It was also observed that the Parsi community had a higher incidence of MS, and the high association of HLA-B12 \\nwas reported among these patients.\\n[29]Kankonkar et al.[30] analyzed the HLA-DRB1 allele associations \\namong non-Parsi MS patients and compared them with \\ncontrols. HLA serologic as well as DRB1 typing was followed. \\nThe study revealed a significant increase of HLA-A11, and \\nfurther molecular subtyping of HLA-DRB1*15 among the \\npatients revealed two novel alleles, DRB1*1506 and DRB1*1508, \\nalong with the commonly reported DRB1*1501 for the first time in MS patients, which had been hitherto unidentified \\nfrom other parts of  India  and the world.

The association of \\nMS with the HLA class II loci DR and DQ were studied in the Asian Indian population in the UK. The putative haplotype, DRB1*150l.DQA1*0102.DQB 1*0602, was found to be nominally associated with MS. The data suggested that other genetic and/or environmental factors may be more important in predisposing to MS in Asian Indians living in the UK.\\nPandit et al.\\n[31] found the role of non-major histopathology \\ncomplex (MHC) disease susceptibility loci in the Asian \\npopulation and that the disease-identifying genes in the Indian population were similar to those in the West. They tested for 15 loci outside the MHC in 197 Indian patients and 197 controls.

The phenotypic \\npresentation of MS in India seems quite similar to the West, \\nand it has also been observed that some of the genes in Indian \\npatients are similar to those seen in the Western patient \\npopulation. Large epidemiological studies are needed to \\nstudy MS incidence and prevalence in India.

In the small Parsi population of around 70,000 in India, \\nBharucha et al. ,[6] reported a higher prevalence of ~21/100,000 \\nwith wide confidence limits. Another study of the same Parsi \\ncommunity by Wadia and Bhatia[7] reported a higher incidence \\nof ~26/100,000. In a recent epidemiological survey, a prevalence \\nof 8/100,000 was noted in urban Mangalore.[8]\\nThe precise cause of MS is still unknown. Extensive research \\nhas shown that both environmental and genetic factors play \\na significant role. The studies in concord twins and a higher \\nprevalence among the siblings of MS patients have suggested a \\nrole of genetic factors in the causation of MS[9,10] Studies of HLA \\nclass II genes, located on chromosome 6, which participates \\nin the presentation of antigens to T cells, has been of special \\ninterest to MS researchers. The HLA linkage studies in the West, \\nespecially among North and West Europeans have suggested a \\nrole of HLA DRB*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602 in MS.[11] There \\nare few reports of HLA linkage in Indian subjects.

It has been \\nwell known in the West since its first description by Charcot[1] \\nin 1868. In India, the disease came to be recognized only in the \\n1960s when physicians who received training in Neurology \\nin the West, returned to India. Baldev Singh,[2] Bharucha[3] \\nand Ramamurthy[4] were the ones who first described the \\nmanifestations of MS in Indian context.\\nThe prevalence data has shown that the frequency of MS varies \\nin different populations. In the USA and UK, the frequency \\nis about 90 to 150/100,000. In contrast, calculations based \\non the hospital data in the 1970s suggested an approximate \\nprevalence rate of only 0.17 to 1.33 per 100,000 in different parts \\nof India.[5] With increased awareness, a significant increase in \\nthe number of neurologists and relatively easy availability of \\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the current estimate stands \\nat about 7 to 10/100,000.

The migration studies by Dean and Elian[15] \\nhave further supported the ‘environmental’ hypothesis where \\npersons migrating before the age of 15 years carry the risk of \\nthe country of origin while persons migrating after the age of \\n15 years have the risk of their adopted country. The increase in \\nMS prevalence with increasing latitude in Europe also supports \\nthe role of environmental factors. Differences in solar radiation \\nand consequent differences in the levels of serum Vitamin D3 \\nmay play a role to account for this latitude difference.[16]\\nAlthough no definite virus as the trigger or cause of MS has yet \\nbeen identified, a case control study by Bansil et al.,[17] in Indian \\npatients noted a higher dog exposure in MS patients than in \\nother neurological diseases, which suggested a possible role \\nof canine distemper virus in MS patients. Recently Epstein-\\nBarr virus (EBV) is believed to play a significant role in the \\npathogenesis of MS.[18] However, Pandit et al.,[19] in a study of \\n140 MS patients did not find evidence for a strong association \\nwith remote EBV infection. Vitamin D is believed to have a \\nprotective effect on developing MS[20] and its deficiency exposes \\nan MS patient to a higher frequency of relapses. It is hard to \\nclearly define the role of vitamin D deficiency in MS in India as \\nvitamin D deficiency is very common in this country. However, \\nthe study by Pandit et al.,[21] does support the hypothesis that \\nVitamin D deficiency has an inverse relationship with MS with \\npersons having low vitamin D levels carrying a higher risk of \\nMS and a greater chance of relapse.\\nThere is no single diagnostic test for MS. The diagnosis requires \\nthat there should be lesions in the white matter of the CNS, \\nwhich should be disseminated in time and space and that there \\nshould be no other diagnostic possibility. Before the advent of \\nMRI, the criteria used were clinical (Schumacher et al.,[22]) and \\nlater on also included laboratory data (Poser et al.,[23]) to define \\nthe categories of definite and possible MS. Today, well-defined \\nMcDonald criteria (revised in 2010)[24] are used, which have \\nincluded MRI findings to diagnose MS. MRI is now available \\nin most metropolitan cities in India and also in several smaller \\ntowns. The protocol followed and the reporting, however, is not \\nalways of a high standard and there is a need for improvement \\nin this regard. The recent revised McDonald criteria[24] have \\nused modified MRI criteria for early diagnosis of MS to enable \\nearly start of the treatment.\\nAlthough Poser criteria[23] used the laboratory data to define \\nlaboratory-supported definite MS, these are not relevant today. \\nAlso, the earlier Indian papers commented on the low yield of \\noligoclonal bands in CSF in the Indian subjects. Regrettably, this \\nwas due to the faulty technique of not using the standardized \\nIso-electric focusing which even today is being used by some \\nbut not all laboratories in India. The use of this technique has \\nresulted in a higher yield of positive cases. It is not mandatory \\nto do the CSF study and several patients opt for avoiding \\nthis study. \\nThe first Indian paper using international criteria of Schumacher \\nwas published by Mathew et al., from Vellore[25] followed by \\nanother paper by Singhal and Wadia[26] describing the clinical \\nfeatures in MS. These papers supported the occurrence \\nof MS in India. For diagnosis of definite MS a histological \\nconfirmation was needed. It was provided by the paper by Dastur and Singhal[27] describing the pathology of two unusual \\ncases of MS. Soon thereafter, several papers from the North \\nWest[28] and other parts of India were published, describing \\nthe clinical features and demographic data concerning MS \\nin India.

The average age of onset is \\n25 to 35 years. Females are about two times more affected than \\nmen. In the Schumacher criteria, age at onset was defined to \\nbe from 15 to 50 years. Of late, it has been well recognized that \\nMS also occurs in the pediatric age group. So far there have \\nbeen no large publications on MS occurring in the pediatric \\nage group, though one does see an occasional patient with MS \\nstarting in childhood.\\nTo study the differences in the clinical presentations of MS in \\nthe Asian patients as compared to the patients in the West, \\nthe late Professor Kuroiwa organized meetings in Japan with \\ndelegates from diverse Asian regions. These discussions were \\nsummed up in the two publications titled Multiple Sclerosis \\nin Asia[30] and Multiple Sclerosis East and West.[31] The \\nessential differences noted were: More frequent initial clinical \\npresentation with optic nerve or spinal cord involvement, often \\nbilateral optic nerve affection, severe myelopathy with sensory \\nlevel, less frequent clinical presentation to suggest cerebral \\nor cerebellar involvement and more frequent painful tonic \\nspasms.[32] These differences were believed to distinguish Asian \\nMS from Western MS. The term optico-spinal MS (OS-MS) was \\nused to emphasize the clinical features in Asian MS.[32] Even \\ntoday the term OS-MS continues to be used, though many of \\nthese patients are cases of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Several \\nothers will also show lesions in the brain MRI at the classical \\nsites seen in MS patients.\\nNMO was considered to be a variant of MS and a monophasic \\nillness in India and several other countries with the distinctive \\nfeatures of involvement of optic nerves and spinal cord within \\na short span of time. With the discovery of Aquaporin 4 \\nantibody by the Mayo group[33] it has now been well established \\nas a distinct disease and frequently having a multiphasic \\ncourse. The criteria for the diagnosis of NMO have been laid \\ndown by Wingerchuk et al.[34] Cases of NMO have now been \\ndescribed from India as well.[35] In the pediatric age group, \\nthe first presentation of MS may occasionally resemble Acute \\nDisseminated Encephalomyelitis. Schilder’s disease and Balo’s \\nconcentric sclerosis are other rare primary demyelinating \\ndisorders. Eale’s syndrome, well known to ophthalmologists \\nwith occasional myelopathy (Singhal and Dastur[36]) may \\nsometimes mimic MS but it is a distinct syndrome. \\nIn the diagnostic criteria of MS, it has been emphasized that \\nother diagnostic possibilities must be excluded. Thus several \\nconditions may result in T2 white matter lesions mimicking \\nMS. Non-specific white matter lesions are frequently seen, \\nespecially in persons with migraine, hypertension and diabetes.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

Sarcoidosis may also \\nhave presentation like MS.\\nThe course of MS in India is largely similar to that in the West \\nthough there has been no well-defined study reported from India \\non this subject. We see patients with ‘Radiologically Isolated \\nSyndrome’, ‘Clinically Isolated syndrome’, with a large majority \\nhaving ‘Remitting Relapsing (RR) course’. As in the West, over \\ntime, in some RR MS patients, phase of ‘Secondary Progressive \\nMS’ sets in. Though the precise figures are not known we also \\nsee patients with ‘Primary Progressive MS’ (PPMS). \\nUntil the early 1980s, the treatment of MS was largely \\nsymptomatic and supportive along with the use of injection \\nACTH or corticosteroids in the acute phase. In the acute phase \\ntoday, the majority of neurologists in India, as elsewhere in the \\nworld, use IV methylprednisolone Gm 1 daily for 3 to 5 days. \\nIf there is no significant benefit, one could also use plasma \\nexchange or IV immunoglobulin.\\nThe recent researches and large multinational trials (India has \\nalso been involved in few recent trials) have provided drugs \\n(approved by agencies like FDA in USA) to delay the onset of \\nrelapse, reduce the number of relapses and also demonstrate \\nsignificant benefit on MRIs (used as surrogate marker). The first \\nones were the β-interferons (three varieties) followed later by \\nglatiramer acetate (all injectable preparations). The introduction \\nof IV Natalizumab in severe cases and in those who do not \\nrespond to interferon or glatiramer acetate showed marked \\nbenefit. However, the occurrence of progressive multifocal \\nleukoencephalopathy due to JC virus has resulted in a word of \\ncaution for its use. All these agents have been made available \\nin India by their parent companies. More recently oral agents \\nlike Fingolimod, Teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate have \\nreceived approval by the drug supervising authorities. Only \\ndimethyl fumarate has been approved and is available in India. \\nIt is recommended that the treatment should be initiated early \\nin the phase of inflammation before the secondary progressive \\nphase sets in. There is as yet no approved therapy for PPMS. \\nThere is no large scale data of the usage of the above-mentioned \\ndisease modifying agents from India. The use of these agents is \\ndetermined by interactive discussion regarding effectiveness, \\nside effects and cost of the drug with the patient and the \\nrelatives. As there is limited support by the government \\n(available mainly for defense personnel and other government \\nemployees) and large multinational companies, most patients \\nhave to bear the expenses themselves. There is as yet no \\ninsurance coverage. As a result, a large majority of patients are \\ndeprived of this therapy. We cannot as yet accurately predict \\nthe course of events in a given patient though there may be \\nsome who remain well. The search for biomarkers continues. \\nThe entity of benign MS is still a matter of debate. The patients \\nin India who remain free of illness for two to three years enquire \\nif they can discontinue the costly drugs but so far we do not \\nhave data to guide them. \\nFor severe MS one could use Mitoxantrone, also approved by \\nthe agencies like FDA. It is available in India at an affordable cost. Singhal et al.,[37] published their experience with this \\ndrug in 21 patients. Other neurologists have used this drug \\nas well. It not only showed benefit in reducing annualized \\nrelapse rate but also showed benefit in reducing disability. \\nHowever, the use of this drug is restricted in view of the \\nrisk of cardiac toxicity and an increased risk of developing \\nleukemia.

Onset of MS remains unclear, however, it is now \\nrecognized that MS can arise during childhood or adolescence.3 MS \\naffects roughly 2.1 million people worldwide with wide geographic \\nvariation.

Attacks of MS may lead \\nto inflammation and injury to the myelin sheath resulting in blocked or slowed nerve \\nsignals that may lead to difficulty in controlling vision, muscle coordination, strength, \\nsensation and other bodily functions. MS was characterized as a disease of the Western \\nHemisphere for several years. However, in the past few years, newer cases were seen \\nin Asia, particularly in regions of China and India, since the presence of MS in these \\nregions has been notable in the light of increasing access to MRI techniques, better \\ndetection and increasing numbers of specialized neurologists in these countries. \\nParticularly in southern India, neuro epidemiological studies demonstrate that \\nthe prevalence of MS has more than doubled in the past thirty years (1.33 vs. 3 \\ncases/100,000). MS-related hospital admissions have nearly doubled in the last decade \\n(1.58% vs. 2.54%). While MS cannot be adequately treated, its symptomatology may \\nbe managed with existing pharmacotherapy. Medications to manage MS are specialty \\nbiologics, usually cost-prohibitive to patients even in high-income countries. India, \\nbeing a Low Middle Income Country (LMIC), has few patients who can afford \\nexpensive out-of-pocket medications.

Geographically, northwest India (above 15 °N \\nlatitude) has an incidence of an average of 4.15 compared to 3.2 in \\nSouth India (below 15 °N latitude). India saw an influx of Persians \\n(now Iranians) in the 8th to 10thcenturies. This population, known \\nas Zoroastrians or Parsis, has an observed prevalence of 26/100,000. \\nSeveral epidemiological studies have indicated high prevalence rates \\nof MS among Iranians, especially in the Ishfahan province adjoining \\nPars. Most neurologists base their diagnoses on the older Poser’s \\ncriteria. It is estimated in several reports that there may be about \\n100,000-200,000 people living with MS in India. With an improved \\nMRI coverage, including governmental plans for expansion of \\nfacilities in rural areas, better estimates of prevalence and incidence \\nmay come about in following years, indicating perhaps a greater need \\nfor services.13 The landscape of clinical MS in India can be expected \\nto change, albeit slowly, with the advent of expanding neurological \\nservices and wider availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \\nThere have been relatively few studies on MS in Asia and \\nparticularly in India. Asian MS has been traditionally thought of as a \\ndistinct entity characterized by high incidence of visual involvement \\nat onset, more severe visual involvement at follow up, prevalence of \\nrecurrent acute transverse myelitis, high incidence of optico-spinal \\ninvolvement, severe involvement of spinal cord with functional \\ndisability and less frequent involvement of cerebellum.8,12,14–17 In April \\n2005, the Indian Government launched a comprehensive National \\nHealth Mission (NHM) to address health challenges in the country. \\nThe NHM addresses several communicable and non-communicable \\ndiseases. However, inclusion of autoimmune and other disorders in \\na separate category may provide much needed impetus to adequately \\nsurvey and record cases for better incidence/prevalence estimates. \\nCost of MS\\nThe total cost of MS in India remains unknown. Disease modifying \\nagents cost approximately $60,000 each year in the U.S. with varying \\ninsurance coverage.18 India’s average per capita annual income \\nwas around $1820 in 2015.19 Currently, India is a low insurance \\nmarket. Approximately 15% of the population has some coverage \\nwith the other 85% paying out-of-pocket. Most of the population’s \\ninsurance coverage comes through government schemes and is \\navailable to governmental employees per the Insurance Regulatory \\nand Development Authority (IRDA). According to the World Health \\nOrganization (WHO), in 2015, India spent only 4.0% of its Gross \\nDomestic Product (GDP) on the health sector (lowest among the \\nBRICS countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa).20 \\nBy contrast in the U.S., approximately 20.9% of GDP is spent on \\nhealthcare, with health insurance estimated to be nearly at 80-85% \\ncoverage. India’s planned healthcare spending increase to 2.5% from \\n1.4% of GDP aimed toward free medications at government facilities, \\nsetting up free ambulances in rural areas, doubling the number of \\ntrained workers, and lifting millions of young children and women \\nout of chronic malnutrition and preventable deaths.21 However, \\nautoimmune and other neurological disorders remained unaddressed. \\nBiosimilars\\nGiven the high cost of MS drugs, Indian life sciences companies \\nhave developed biosimilars or biopharmaceutical products that have \\nsimilar properties as their patented counterparts.

       " Document(page_content='have developed biosimilars or biopharmaceutical products that have \\nsimilar properties as their patented counterparts. Many biosimilars are \\nnow available for MS treatment. Biosimilars, unlike generics consist of human and/or animal materials and are processed through complex \\nbiotechnological processes. Biosimilars are follow-on biologics. \\nEach country has a different mechanism for regulatory approval \\nof biosimilars. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization \\n(CDSCO), which is the regulatory authority for drug approvals in \\nIndia, has approved as many as 50biosimilars for various diseases \\nand provides detailed guidelines for approval of biosimilars. Safety \\nconcerns with biosimilars and biologics involve the potential risk \\nof immune-based adverse reactions and it is important to develop \\nadequate pharmacovigilance measures to adequately address issues of \\nsafety and alleviate risks.22\\nIndia has the 3rd largest pharmaceutical industry in terms of volume \\nin the world. The tremendous capacity to develop and manufacture \\nbiosimilars amidst generics is hailed by watchdog and civil society \\ngroups, including Medicines Sans Frontieres, toward improving \\naffordability and accessibility for a vast percentage of the world’s \\npoor population. Take for example, Avonex (Interferon Beta 1a 30 \\nmcg prefilled syringe) that costs around INR 30,000 per syringe (USD \\n$500). Patients would have to inject Avonex once a week putting \\nmonthly costs at ~INR 120,000 (USD $2,000). Average incomes in \\nIndia fall under INR 10,000 per month23 thereby making this drug \\nhighly unaffordable. A bio similar called Relibeta (30mcg prefilled \\nsyringe) made by Reliance Life Sciences, an Indian biopharmaceuticals \\ncompany is sold for INR 5,623 (USD $93) per syringe. At 4 syringes \\na month, the treatment would come to approximately INR 22,492 \\n(USD $374) that may still be beyond the reach of many patients, but \\nprobably affordable by some. In the absence of feasible solutions for \\nMS, the alternative remains management and prolonging disability. \\nTable 2 below shows the various MS agents available in India and \\ntheir prices.\\nAssociated costs\\nAlong with MS medications, recurring costs for hospitalizations, \\nMRI scans, check-ups, and disability related services must be \\nconsidered in an economic analysis. Adding up these costs in India \\nis difficult due to the varying prices offered by service providers, \\nvarying insurance coverage and lack of standardized databases where \\nsuch information may be captured. \\nOff-label use\\nIn recent years, off-label medications have found use for managing \\nsymptoms in MS patients and are often used when patients have \\nexhausted all MS medication treatments, are unable to pay the cost \\nof MS treatments (including biosimilars), are looking for cheaper \\nalternatives, or are looking for a different side effect profile. Some \\nstudies in the scientific literature have shown value and promise with \\nthe use of certain immune suppressing medications toward managing \\nMS in patients. Off-label medications, such as Rituximab, Modafinil \\n(Provigil), and Azathioprine, are reportedly used by patients who may \\nor may not have exhausted all standard-of-care options (personal \\ncommunications with MS patients). However, in the absence of \\nscientific rigor and an U.S. FDA indication, outcomes are difficult \\nto assess. Autoimmune diseases may require heavy monitoring for \\nimmune-mediated responses thereby necessitating neurologists and \\npatients to take charge with extensive follow-ups to maximize utility \\nand minimize risks. Chemotherapeutic agents and other immune \\nmodifying drugs will continue to be studied for other uses including \\nmanaging MS.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 95}),\n",

While most \\nreports have identified costs of MS drugs as significantly high with \\nexpected future increases, there is currently very little push from \\nauthorities in India to regulate or monitor specialty drug prices, \\nthough stands against multinationals are being taken on certain \\nissues. Another parallel and significant issue is the use of off-label \\nprescription drugs to prolong disability amongst MS patients.

Multifocal zones \\nof inflammation due to focal T-lymphocytic and \\nmacrophage infiltrations, and oligodendrocyte death are the primary causes of myelin sheath de-struction (2) that result in the formation of  CNS plaques composed of inflammatory cells and their products, demyelinated and transected axons, and astrogliosis in both white and gray matter. These lesions can cross-talk with the correct transmission of nerve impulses and lead to neuronal dysfunc-tion such as autonomic and sensorimotor defects, visual disturbances, ataxia, fatigue, difficulties in thinking, and emotional problems (1).\\nSubtypes of MS are considered important not \\nonly for prognosis but also for treatment decisions \\nand include: relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), pri-mary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progres-sive MS (SPMS), and progressive relapsing MS (PRMS). RRMS is the most common subtype (ap-proximately 87%) which characterized by unpre-dictable acute attacks followed by periods of re-mission (3). During RRMS, inflammatory attacks on myelin and nerve fibers occur. Activated im-mune cells cause lesions in the CNS which gener -\\nate symptoms of visual impairments, tingling and numbness, episodic bouts of fatigue, intestinal and urinary system disorders, spasticity, and learning and memory impairment. Approximately 10-15% of MS patients are diagnosed with PPMS which', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n",

PPMS pa-\\ntients tend to have fewer brain lesions. Induced symp-toms include problems with walking, weakness, stiff-ness, and trouble with balance. Nearly 65% of patients with RRMS will subsequently develop SPMS which is considered the second phase of this disease. Many \\nindividuals experience increased weakness, intestinal \\nand urinary system disorders, fatigue, stiffness, men-tal disorders, and psychological impairment. Finally, PRMS is the least common type of MS that occurs in approximately 5% of patients and is associated with symptoms such as eye pain and double vision, along with sexual, intestinal and urinary system dysfunc-tion, dizziness, and depression. Generally MS is de-tected between the ages of 20 and 40 years, but less than 1% can occur in childhood and approximately 2-10% after 50 years of age (4, 5).\\nThis pathologic condition affects women more than \\nmen (sex ratio 2.5:1) and the prevalence varies by geographic area, ranging from 120 per 100,000 indi-viduals (6, 7). The etiology of MS remains unclear, however it can be considered a multifactorial disease \\nand include a genetic predisposition combined with \\nenvironmental influences (8).\\nThe initial treatment strategy for MS is largely based \\non disease-modifying drugs such as interferon-β and glatiramer acetate (9, 10). The effects of these treat-\\nments are partially for symptomatic alleviation and do \\nnot stop the ongoing neurodegeneration.\\nCurrently, a stem cell-based regenerative medicine \\nparadigm has been proposed for the treatment of MS (11-13). Adult stem cells, including hematopoietic and \\nmesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are undifferentiated \\ncells used to treat MS due to their immunomodulatory effects and neuroprotective potential (14).\\nWe review the pathogenesis, a number of envi-\\nronmental factors, genetic susceptibility, diagnos-\\ntic criteria, and treatment of MS.\\nPathogenesis of multiple sclerosis \\nInflammation of the white and gray matter \\ntissues in the CNS due to focal immune cell \\ninfiltration and their cytokines are the incipient \\ncause of damage in MS. Many studies have suggested T helper (Th) cell (also known as CD4+ T cells)  intervention and adaptive immune \\nresponses which initiated by interaction between \\nantigen presenting cells (APCs) with T lymphocytes \\nplay an important role in the initiation and progression of MS (15, 16). Pathogen-associated molecules simultaneously bind to toll-like receptors on APCs and production of specific cytokines that include interleukin (IL)-12, IL-23 and IL-4 begins that these cytokines induce CD4+ T cell differentiation intoTh1, Th2, or Th17 phenotypes which have ability to release \\nspecial cytokines. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) or type II \\ninterferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) are proinflammatory cytokines critical for innate and adaptive immunity. These cytokines are produced by Th1 cells (17).They have the ability to promote inflammation by suppressing Th2 differentiation. Th2 cells secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13 (18, 19). IL-4 reduces pathological inflammation via increase in M2 macrophage (or repair macrophages) and alternative activation of M1 macrophages that promote inflammation. The effects \\nof IL-13 on immune cells is similar to IL-4. This \\ncytokine, by secretion of matrix metalloproteinase, has anti-inflammatory properties especially during allergic inflammation (20). Th17 is another CD4+ T cells which induces a large number of cytokines (IL-17, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-26) which are capable of promoting inflammation (Fig.1A) (21).\\nB lymphocytes and their cytokines are other', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

Lymphotoxin [or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)] and TNF-α produced by these cells promotes inflammation. In addition, these cells are capable of producing IL-10 which is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Hence, B lymphocytes have both positive and negative effects in the development of MS (22).\\nMany studies have shown that in addition to the \\nabove-mentioned cells, CD8+ T cells (or cytotoxic T \\ncells) can be found in MS lesions (23).

In addition to CNS inflammation, the myelin repair process due to oligodendrocyte \\ndeath is also impaired (16).\\nFas ligand (FasL) is produced by lymphocyte \\ncells. This ligand binds to Fas receptors [cell surface receptor that belongs to the TNF receptor superfamily] on oligodendrocyte cells which begins the apoptosis process of these cells (24).

NO is a \\ntoxic soluble gas that in pathological concentrations \\ncan damage neurons and oligodendrocytes (31, 32). \\nLipid peroxidation and mitochondrial damage that \\nresult from NO can lead to oligodendrocytes apoptosis, \\naxonal degeneration, and demyelination (33).\\nA previous study has shown that CO exposure leads to blockage of tissue oxygenation (34), myelin basic protein (MBP) degradation, and axonal injury as well as a subsequent inflammatory response including activated microglia and CD4+ lymphocyte invasion of the CNS, which results in demyelination (35).\\nVitamin deficiency (especially vitamins D and \\nB12) are considered risk factors for MS. Vitamin \\nD comprises a group of fat-soluble secosteroids \\nthat include vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and \\nvitamin D2 (ergocalciferol).

Thus, deficiency of this vitamin can be a major cause for neurological diseases such as MS. The results of a previous study on MS patients have indicated \\nthat the application of vitamin B12 benefitted the \\nclinical course of MS (42).\\nBeyond vitamin deficiency, low-term sunlight \\nexposure has been identified as a potential risk \\nfactor for MS. The results of a previous study \\nhave demonstrated a reverse association among exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the incidence of MS (30). In justifying this relationship, it can be said that sun light is a principal source of vitamin D3 and via induction of T regulatory (Treg) cells \\nand anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and \\nTNF-α, it may have immunomodulatory effects in MS (43).\\nAccording to previous reports, diet could be \\nan environmental factor involved in MS (44). \\nStudies reported a significant negative association between MS risk and high fish intake (45), a positive significant association between high animal fat-based caloric intake and MS risk (46), a non-significant lower risk between incidence of \\nMS and a higher intake of linoleic acid (28), and a \\npositive significant association between obesity in adolescent girls and MS risk (47).\\nGenetic susceptibility\\nA genetic predisposition may be involved in \\nMS. Studies show that the risk of MS in family \\nmembers of a patient depends on the amount of \\ngenetic information they share (48-50). Thus, the risk rate in monozygotic-twins that have 100% genetic similarity is approximately 25%. In all individuals who have 50% genetic similarities such as dizygotic twins and first degree relative s, \\nthis risk is 2-5% (51, 52). In addition, the risk \\nin second degree relatives with 25% genetic similarity is 1-2%, whereas in third degree relatives with 12.5% genetic similarity, this risk \\nis less than 1% (48-50). It has been shown that in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region of \\nchromosome 6 exists a group of genes associated with an increased risk of MS. Within this region HLA-DR2+ (53), HLA-DQ6 (1), DQA 0102 and DQB1 0602 (54), HLA-DRB1 (54), DR15 (55), DRB1*1501, and DRB1*1503 (56) are genes \\nsusceptible to the onset of MS. In addition to these \\nalleles, IL-7 and IL-2 receptor alpha are other sensitive genes associated with MS (57). Unlike the aforementioned genes, HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11 have protective effects (1).\\nClinical manifestations\\nUsually, MS symptoms are unpredictable and \\nuncertain. Since this disease can affect any region \\nof the CNS, it can generate almost any neurologic symptom. In addition, symptoms vary greatly among patient and within one patient over time. During the course of MS, some abnormalities appear to be more dominant or have a greater effect on functional ability. Table 1 lists the more common symptoms of MS that may appear during \\ndifferent courses of the disease (58).\\nDiagnosis of multiple sclerosis \\nEarly detection of MS is important because it \\ngives us the opportunity to seek treatment and \\nplan for the future. An exact diagnosis of MS is based on medical history and neurological examination using imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar punctures (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \\nanalysis, evoked potentials, and blood samples \\nanalysis (59).

However, immunomodulating and anti-\\ninflammatory agents can diminish its progression and decrease some of the pathological symptoms. Immunomodulating agents including interferon beta and glatiramer acetate are used in non-symptomatic MS, RRMS, and SPMS (63). These agents can lessen some of the MS symptoms by inhibition of immune cell activation, decrease of proinflammatory cytokines production, matrix \\nmetalloproteinase activity reduction, induction of \\nanti-inflammatory cytokine secretion (64), and by increasing expression of Foxp3 in CD4+ and CD25+Treg cells (65).\\nOthers agents such ascorticosteroids (inhibit \\nlymphocyte proliferation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines) (66), mitoxantrone (inhibit macrophage mediated myelin degradation and diminish the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines) (67), cyclophosphamide (increases Th2 cells) (68), mycophenolate (inhibits immune cell activation and migration through the blood brain barrier) (69), and methotrexate (reduces inflammation) (70) are used in RRMS and SPMS.\\nGenerally, these agents do not halt the ongoing \\nprogression of neurodegeneration. Therefore, other strategies such as stem cell-based therapy are proposed as potential novel paradigms for the treatment of MS.\\nAccess to human MS neural tissue is limited and \\nneural tissue biopsies are rarely performed. Hence, a variety of mammalian species - mice, rats, goats, pigs, sheep, rabbits, and non-human primates can be used for cell transplantation in order to study various aspects of MS (71).

To date, cell transplantation experiments that have been conducted for MS treatment pursued at least one of these points.\\nMSCs are stem cells with the capability to \\ndifferentiate into other cells. They display several significant anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic features (14). These cells are proven to be potentially effective in MS treatment \\ndue to their immunomodulatory properties \\n(regulation and maintenance of Treg lymphocyte function) (72) and paracrine effects (via bioactive growth factor secretion and IL-6 and TGF-β production) (73). \\nPreviously, Mikaeili Agah et al. (74) reported \\nthat human Wharton’s jelly stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (hWJ-MSC-derived OPCs) transplanted into the brain ventricles of an MS mouse model significantly diminished the clinical signs of MS and induced functional improvements. In addition, histological examinations demonstrated that hWJ-MSC-derived OPCs transplantation promoted the regeneration of myelin sheaths in the brain lesions. Pluchino et al. (75) reported similar functional improvements \\nfollowing transplantation of adult neural stem \\ncell into an animal model of MS. The result of \\nthis study demonstrated that significant numbers \\nof transplanted cells migrated into demyelinating \\nlesions and differentiated into mature cells. They observed functional recovery due to remyelination improvement following increased oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and decreased astrogliosis. As \\nseen, these studies with hWJ-MSC and adult neural \\nstem cell were conducted for cell replacement and not considered for other cell t herapy purposes.\\nMSCs derived from human embryonic stem cells \\n(hES-MSCs) appeared to be a better cell source \\ncompared to human bone marrow-derived MSCs \\n(BM-MSCs) for treatment in a mouse model of MS [experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)] due \\nto BM-MSCs increased IL-6 expression. The results showed that hES-MSCs considerably decreased clinical signs and prevented neuronal demyelination. The EAE disease-modifying effect of hES-MSCs was much higher than BM-MSCs (76).\\nAvailable evidence indicated that placental \\nMSCs showed therapeutic effects in an EAE mouse model of MS. These effects were caused by reduction of anti-inflammatory proteins such as TNF-α-stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) in the inflammatory regions (77). Trubiani et al. (78) reported  that human periodontal ligament \\nstem cells (hPDLSCs) seemed to be ideal sources \\nfor MS treatment due to their ability to secrete neurotrophic factors and by modulate expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, Nrf2, and Foxp3.\\nRecently, it has been reported that olfactory \\nensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation in a cuprizone model of MS improved myelin restoration through modification of MBP and phospholipid P (PLP) levels of the myelin sheath (79).  Ravanidis et al. (80) demonstrated that subcutaneously transplanted neural precursor cells improved the clinical outcome and pathological features of EAE by modulating chemokine levels.\\nBai et al.

ADSCs have the ability to secrete many identified NTF factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, \\nand glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor \\n(84). In addition, ADSCs have other beneficial characteristics such as their lack of both HLA-class II antigen expression and thus xenogeneic transplantation possibility (85); their ability to migrate through α4ß1 expression (86); and high antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects (87, 88).\\nIn our previous studies we have shown that \\nhuman ADSC transplantation into a lysolecithin lesion as a model of MS led to recovery of locomotor function and decreased pathological signs such as demyelination (11, 89). These results were consistent with other recent studies which showed that intravenous administration of human adipose-derived MSCs could reverse \\nclinical course of EAE, particularly at the peak \\nof this disease via downregulation of IL-17 (90). These findings might be explained by the fact that ADSCs with a wide range of valuable properties could replace degenerated neurons, provide a proper environment for retention of the remaining neurons, and promote tissue regeneration. Therefore, ADSCs could pursue the goals of cell transplantation and might be considered a proper cell source candidate for cell based therapy in treatment of MS.\\nConclusion\\nThe precise cause of MS is unknown. \\nNonetheless, genetic predispositions combined with environmental influences play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The therapeutic effects of several agents including immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory drugs \\nin MS have been studied. However, current \\ntreatments are not able to halt the ongoing progression of neurodegeneration. Thus, beside drug therapies, ADSCs which pursue the goals of cell transplantation may potentially provide a novel \\nstrategy for treatment of neurological diseases.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors are grateful to the Iranian Council of Stem Cell Technology and Isfahan University of \\nMedical Sciences for their financial support (Grant no. 189067).

       " Document(page_content='© 2006 - 2018 Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow 95Editorial\\nThis issue of AIAN has many articles on multiple \\nsclerosis (MS), so I thought of reviewing article published \\non MS from India. Older belief that MS is rare in India to \\npresent setting of suspecting MS in every correct case scenario \\nhas been shown by increasing number of publications from \\nIndia. This article has tried to review publication on MS from \\nIndian authors.\\nSince the first publication of 6 cases by Singh and Gupta,[1] \\nthere has been increasing number of publication from India, \\ndue to improving diagnostic facility including pathologically \\ncases by Dastur and Singhal.[2]\\nSinghal and Wadia, described 30 cases of MS and neuromyelitis \\noptica (NMO), observed over 15 years breaking the myth that \\nMS is uncommon in India.[3] Chopra et al. reported 54 patients \\nwith MS from Northwest India with 2 pathologically \\nproven cases and 5 cases with Devic’s disease.[4] This study \\nreported more common occurrence of optic neuritis (ON), \\nmyelopathy, and higher incidence of classical neuromyelitis \\noptica (NMO). Wadia and Bhatia reported MS in Parsi \\npopulation with a crude prevalence ratio of 26–58/100,000 \\nfrom\\u200a Mumbai/Pune=(age-adjusted prevalence ratio for \\nMumbai was 24/100,000, with 95% confidence limits of \\n13.1–40.3, which is same as the rest of the world.[5,6] Trikannad \\net al.[7] reported HLA -B12 in Parsi and non-Parsi Indians. \\nChand and Devi showed the utility of blink reflex and \\nsomatosensory-evoked potential in predicting conversion of ON \\nto clinically suspect MS.[8] Jain and Maheshwari complied data \\nof largest case series of 354 cases of MS published from India \\nover the previous three decades and again confirmed higher \\nincidence of ON and NMO.[9] The study also reported that MS \\nmight be more common in northern part of India as compared \\nto south based on this data. Singhal[10] reported approximate \\nprevalence rate of 0.17–1.33/100,000 of population in different \\nparts of India based on hospital data record (105 cases of \\nclinical data management systems [CDMS] and 14 cases of \\nNMO from Mumbai region, 1957–1983). The study reported \\nthat MS in India is more like other Asian countries as compared \\nto the West with higher incidence of NMO (6%). Common MS \\nwas opticospinal form of MS (71.4%) but lesser of cerebellar \\ninvolvement in the higher socioeconomic group.\\nBansil et al. compared the population of India and USA in \\na case–control study and concluded that involvement of the \\ncerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, spinal cord and brainstem \\nwere same including disease progression while ON was more \\nfrequent in Indian patients. There were no familial cases.[11] In \\nanother publication, Bansil et al. looked at environmental risk \\nfactors in Indian patients and reported no difference in prior \\nforeign travel, surgeries, blood transfusions, clinical chicken \\npox and mumps infections and exposure to cats/farm animals as risk factors. There was more exposure to clinical measles \\ninfection and dog exposure in the MS patients.[12]\\nSingh et al. studied differences in imaging of MS and acute \\ndisseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). The study included \\n33 patients with 14 as CDMS and 19 as ADEM.[13] Banerjee \\net al. first reported pediatric MS.[14] Chopra et al. (2002) \\nevaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-1-globulin in MS and \\nADEM. It was significantly higher in ADEM (P < 0.05). The \\nnegative predictive value (>6.5%) was 100% for diagnosing \\nMS helping in differentiating between MS and ADEM patients. \\nSahota et al. evaluated the utility of transcranial magnetic \\nstimulation (TMS) as diagnostic utility in MS.[15] The study \\nfound TMS to be very useful tool in detecting corticospinal \\nconduction abnormalities in MS that may have no clinical \\ncorrelate and in monitoring the course of the disease.\\nNarayan et al. reported MS in Keralite migrated to Middle East', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 109}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='What is a clinical trial? \\n1Before a new medicine is approved for use in a wider population, it must undergo extensive \\ntesting and be approved by relevant regulatory agencies. Clinical trials are carefully designed \\nand monitored research studies to test investigational study drugs, devices or procedures to \\nfind out if they are safe and effective before they can be approved for marketing and use for \\ngeneral public. The investigational product may be new and not tested on human beings before, \\nor may be an existing medicine on the market that is going to be used in a new way. \\nWhy should I take part in a clinical trial? \\n2People take part in clinical trials for a number of reasons. If you are a patient with a health \\ncondition, you may wish to receive new investigational drugs that are intended to treat your \\nhealth condition before these drugs become widely available. This may be because your health \\ncondition is not responding to standard medical treatment. Your participation will also help \\nadvance understanding of the disease and how to treat it. Everyone who takes part in a clinical \\ntrial is playing an important role in understanding a disease and making new medicines available. \\nWho is eligible to take part in a clinical trial? 3 Each clinical trial uses specific criteria to determine if a person is eligible to participate. \\nThese criteria include specific factors, such as age, type of disease, medical history and current \\nhealth. Depending on the study, participants may be healthy individuals or those with the \\nparticular illness being studied. Well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria are put in place for \\nevery clinical trial to ensure that only eligible participants are chosen for the study. \\nDoes a person have to have an illness to take part in a trial? 4 Those who take part in a trial can be healthy volunteers or patients with an existing illness, \\ndepending on the phase and requirements of the study. A Phase I trial is performed on healthy \\nvolunteers (with the exception of studies on cancer medicines) and is designed to determine the \\nto check for any potential side effects. These trials usually involve a small number of participants. \\nIn Phase I trials, volunteers generally stay in a specially designed, hospital-like clinical unit during \\nthe entire duration of the study so that they can be monitored around the clock to confirm their \\nsafety. Phase II-IV studies are performed on patients who are suffering from the existing illness \\nunder investigation. In Phase II-IV studies, the patient is expected to periodically visit the hospital \\nor clinic where the study is taking place. The frequency of these visits depends on the drug and \\ndisease being studied and study protocol, and the patient is closely monitored by the doctor in \\ncharge of the study as well as his/her study staff. \\nHow can a patient take part in a clinical trial? \\n5If the study doctor feels that a patient may qualify to take part in a study, the doctor invites \\nhim/her to take part in the study and takes him/her through the informed consent process. This \\nconsists of the doctor providing written information about the study to the patient in the \\nlanguage he/she is most comfortable with and explaining the risks and benefits of taking part in \\nthe study of the patient . The patient is informed that taking part in a trial is purely voluntary and', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 113}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='he/she can choose not to take part in a trial. Once a patient voluntarily decides to take part in \\na clinical trial, he/she has to go through a detailed assessment to see if he/she qualifies for \\nthe study. \\nWhat kind of information should a participant ask before deciding to take part in a \\nclinical trial? 6 A potential study participant has the right to know and should ask the study doctors any \\nquestions he/she has related to the conduct of the trial and its potential impact on him/her \\nbefore volunteering to take part. Some of these questions are: \\n1.Has the study drug been tested on humans\\nbefore? If so, to what extent? What was the\\noutcome?\\n2.What is the purpose of this study ?\\n3.What are the likely benefits?\\n4.What are the known and possible risks?\\n5.Will any invasive procedures be carried\\nout?\\n6.What is the study drug type and how often\\nwill it have to be taken?7.How long will the study and each study\\nvisit last?\\n8.How often will I need to come to the\\nhospital or clinic to take part?\\n9.What happens in case I become ill or\\ndevelop any side effects?\\n10.What other treatment options do I have if\\nI choose not to take part in the trial? If I enroll\\nin the trial, do I have an option to stop taking\\npart in the trial at any time? What happens to\\nmy treatment if I decide not to continue?\\nWhat is the Informed Consent Process? 7 Informed consent refers to the process by which a potential clinical trial participant is informed \\nby the doctor conducting the clinical trial of all the details of the study prior to his/her \\nparticipation in a study. This includes treatment details and possible risks and benefits. This \\nconsent process must be done in a language that the patient is most comfortable with. The \\n\"Informed Consent Form\"which contains all details about the study is used to aid the \\ndiscussion. This document is written at a level that can be understood by a lay person and is \\napproved by the Ethics Committee overseeing the study. The Informed Consent Form must be \\nsigned by the patient and the doctor prior to the subject\\'s participation in a study, and a copy of \\nthe signed form must be handed over to the patient to keep. If the patient is unable to \\nread/write, the study doctor provides all the information verbally and an impartial witness needs \\nto be present during the entire informed consent discussion and must sign the Informed \\nConsent Form indicating that all necessary information was provided to the patient. The \\ninformed consent process is required to be recorded on video under new guidelines in India. \\nHow are a patients rights protected? \\n8Patient safety is of utmost importance in any clinical trial. Clinical study protocols are \\ndeveloped to ensure that risks to study participants are minimized. These protocols are \\ncarefully reviewed by an Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee as well as country \\nregulatory authority before a clinical trial can start.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",

We also become  \\nmore likely to develop additional health conditions. \\nFor these reasons and more, people with MS are  \\nincreasingly interested in how they can maximise their  \\nphysical and cognitive abilities, manage their MS well,  \\nand get the most out of life as they get older.

Generally, a person experiencing symptoms consistent with early MS will seek advice from their family doctor/primary care physician or a hospital. Once the \\npossibility of MS has been recognized, an urgent referral needs to be made to a neurologist – a doctor \\nwho specializes in diseases of the nervous system.\\nMS is a complex disease. A neurologist with a special interest in MS, together with their team, will be \\nbest placed to provide a diagnosis and an integrated approach to care and management. Such neurologists have broad experience of the long-term management of MS and in-depth knowledge of \\nthe latest diagnostic criteria, treatment options and monitoring processes. MS specialist nurses are \\nkey team members in many services. They can help to improve knowledge, confidence and the ability to cope,\\n19 provide emotional support20 and are highly valued by people with MS.21\\nIt is now possible to diagnose MS earlier than ever before, thanks to evidence from MRI brain scans.22 \\nDiagnosis now happens at least 10 times more quickly than in the early 1980s,23 and about one in five \\npeople who have had a single relapse can receive a firm diagnosis from their first MRI scans.24 For \\nothers, further appointments for MRI scans and clinical examinations will ensure that a diagnosis can be made as soon as possible. A prompt diagnosis means that people with MS and their healthcare \\nprofessionals can start to treat and manage the disease as early as possible.\\nEarly treatment with a DMT can reduce  \\ndisease activity\\nIn people with relapsing forms of MS, starting treatment with a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) \\nearly in the disease course is associated with better long-term outcomes than delaying treatment.25 \\nDifferent DMTs act on the body in different ways and each is associated with a particular set of benefits and possible side effects. Choosing the most appropriate DMT for you is therefore something \\nto talk about with your healthcare professionals (see page 5 for suggested topics), along with how to \\nlead a brain-healthy lifestyle (see page 3).What can you do?\\n\\x84\\x84Ask for urgent referral to a neurologist if MS is suspected, preferably to one with a special interest in MS, or to an MS specialist clinic.\\n\\x84\\x84Request early access to diagnostic procedures, including MRI.\\n\\x84\\x84Stay in touch with your MS team for ongoing monitoring if you do not receive a diagnosis straight away.\\nWhat can you do?\\n\\x84\\x84Ask your healthcare professionals whether it is appropriate to start treatment with a DMT and find out which options are available.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 194}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='7\\nBrain health: a guide for people with multiple sclerosisBackground: the brain health  \\nperspective on MS\\nIn MS, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks and damages tissue in the brain, spinal cord and \\noptic nerve (the central nervous system). Although it is normal for healthy adults to lose small amounts of brain tissue as they get older, this process happens more quickly in people with MS \\n(Figure 2a).\\n26,27 For many people with the disease, this causes physical disability, fatigue and cognitive \\nproblems (e.g. difficulties with concentration, memory and learning new things).\\nMS is most often diagnosed in people aged 20–40 years. The exact range of symptoms experienced \\nby each person can vary, depending on the locations of tissue damage in the central nervous system. In addition, for many people with MS, areas of intensive damage (known as lesions) may noticeably disrupt nerve function and lead to attacks of worsened symptoms and impairment (known as relapses). All lesions contribute to tissue loss even if they do not cause a relapse (Figure 2b).\\nThe brain is a remarkably flexible organ. When learning new skills, such as speaking a foreign \\nlanguage or playing a musical instrument, it can recruit new areas to use for these tasks. In a similar \\nway, if a part of the brain has been damaged, new areas can be recruited to help with the tasks \\npreviously performed by the damaged area. Thus, new areas of the brain can be recruited to compensate when MS causes damage to brain tissue.\\n28,29\\nThe capacity of the brain to adapt is known as neurological reserve, and the more neurological reserve a brain has the healthier it is. However, it is now known that MS can be active even when someone is feeling well. Research has shown that only about one in 10 lesions leads to a relapse,\\n30,31 \\nand that other, less noticeable, damage can also be ongoing.32 So, even if someone is not \\nexperiencing new or worsened symptoms, the brain may be using up some of its neurological reserve to compensate for damage (Figure 2c). If all of its neurological reserve is used up, the brain can no \\nlonger recruit new areas and the symptoms of MS are more likely to progress (Figure 2d).\\nNeurological reserve is a valuable resource that plays a large part in having a healthy brain that \\nfunctions well. The earlier sections of this document have explained how you can take positive action to maximize your lifelong brain health whatever your MS diagnosis.\\nWhat can you do?\\n\\x84\\x84Be aware that MS disease activity may be ongoing even when you feel well and that this can threaten brain health.\\n\\x84\\x84Ask your healthcare professionals how they plan to monitor your MS to see whether the disease is active (see page 5).\\n\\x84\\x84Discuss with others, including your healthcare professionals, why neurological reserve and brain health are important.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 195}),\n",

This can make \\nit difficult to understand or explain to \\nothers who may interpret it in the wrong \\nway. It is often described as heavy \\ntiredness (lassitude), general weakness \\nor lack of energy but for some it may be \\ndescribed as total exhaustion.The reality is that every definition is \\ncorrect because the experience is \\nsubjective and everyone experiences \\nMS fatigue differently.\\nUnlike ordinary fatigue, MS fatigue  \\ncan occur suddenly, usually without \\nreason, lasting longer and taking longer \\nto recover from. It can be temporary such as during a relapse (known as ‘short \\ncircuiting’), an infection or unrelated \\nillness, or when starting some MS \\nmedications. Alternatively, it can be \\nongoing (chronic), even after rest. \\nMS fatigue can temporarily worsen \\nother MS symptoms (such as muscle \\nweakness or vision issues), but for  \\nsome people this can reduce again \\nafter rest. MS fatigue can also result \\nfrom the effect of other MS symptoms \\nsuch as mobility (walking) problems, \\npain, muscle weakness or depression. Sometimes people experience \\ncognitive fatigue, which affects \\nmemory, learning, concentration, \\nmaking decisions and attention  \\nspan (also known as ‘brain fog’).\\nSome people experience chronic  \\nMS fatigue, which means it is \\nfrequently present, even when \\nresting. It often increases in the \\nsecond part of the day and can be \\nmade worse by stress or heat.\\n“Fatigue is the most invisible of \\nMS symptoms!

It is \\nthought to result from a range of different factors, partly \\ncaused by MS itself (known as primary fatigue) and partly \\nby other factors (secondary fatigue).\\nPrimary MS fatigue is due to changes \\nin the brain and damage to the central \\nnervous system. The damage affects \\nthe nerves by interrupting messages \\nfrom the brain and spinal cord to the rest \\nof the body. As a result, your body has \\nto work harder to function, which can \\nlead to a build-up of MS fatigue. Muscle \\nweakness and cognitive demands are \\nalso affected by the changes in the \\nbrain, so they too use more energy, \\nwhich can lead to MS fatigue. Secondary MS fatigue occurs from the \\neffects of living with MS. For instance, \\nMS symptoms such as depression, \\npain or sleep disturbance from \\nspasms or incontinence can all make \\nMS fatigue worse. MS fatigue may \\nalso occur as a side effect of some \\nmedications or from inactivity, stress, \\npoor diet or an infection. Other medical \\nconditions can also cause or worsen \\nMS fatigue.“Fatigue in multiple sclerosis \\nis something quite special \\nbecause, we can sleep \\nas much as we want, it \\ndoesn’t change anything. \\nIt’s really like a crushing \\nexhaustion. You can be \\nfine and in a few minutes \\nyou feel exhausted, and \\neverything gets too hard. \\nMoving, eating, working, \\ntalking... everything \\nbecomes very hard! It’s like \\nyour body falls asleep for \\nyou, but your head doesn’t \\nfall asleep. Sometimes even \\nsleeping is also too difficult, \\nbecause your body has gone \\nout but not your head.”\\nMarie  from France has been  \\nliving with MS since 2016Kimiko from Japan has been \\nliving with MS since 1970\\n7 6', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 204}),\n",

Moreover, it also pushed \\nme to think of all the other caregivers \\nwho need a resource that would help \\nthem manage their lives better. \\nWe have approximately 2500 registered \\nPwMS.

In up to 78% of cases, this care is provided \\nby a spouse or partner. The daily requirements of \\ncaregiving can result in physical, psychological, \\nemotional, social, and financial stressors. Those providing \\ncare may need to confront having to make significant \\nchanges to their working lives, may experience an \\nimpact on their personal and social lives, and may \\nhave to adjust their living arrangements and other \\npractical aspects of life. \\nExisting research on PwMS has largely focussed on negative \\nimpacts of MS for carers and has painted a rather bleak view of the \\nfuture. There is, however, an emerging body of literature regarding positive impacts of \\nMS on partners, such as gaining insight into illness and hardship, personal growth, \\na re-evaluation of life’s priorities and goals, and a greater appreciation of life and of \\none’s own health.

       " Document(page_content='10 TIPS FOR PEOPLE NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\\nRecently diagnosed with MS? These tips can help you prepare for what\\'s ahead.\\nEducating yourself about MS can ease your fears and help you better manage the disease.\\nA multiple sclerosis diagnosis can be frightening and overwhelming, but while you may feel \\nvery much alone, you are by no means the only one dealing with this condition.\\nMultiple sclerosis is the most common disabling neurological disease in young adults, \\nusually striking between ages 20 and 40, according to the National Institute of Neurological \\nDisorders and Strok e. Nearly one million people in the United States are living with MS, per \\nthe National Multiple Sclerosis Societ y (NMS S), as are more than 2.3 million/ 23 Lakh \\npeople worldwide. The good news: Most MS symptoms can usually be managed \\nsuccessfully , says Anthon y Reder MD, a multiple sclerosis specialist and professor of \\nneurology at the University of Chicago .\\n\"Symptom management gets better every year with new drugs, techniques, and \\nlifestyle information,\" he explains.\\nIf you\\'ve been newly diagnosed with MS , these tips can help y ou manage the disease.\\n1. Learn as Much as Possible About MS\\nThere are many myths and misconceptions about multiple sclerosis, and without the facts, \\nyour MS diagnosis can be scarier than necessary .\\nMS is a chronic inﬂammatory disease affecting the central nervous system. It occurs when \\nthe immune system causes inﬂammation that damages myelin-the protectiv e insulation \\ncovering nerv e ﬁbers in the br ain and spinal cord- as well as the nerv e ﬁbers themselv es \\nand the cells that make myelin. This damage to the myelin or nerve ﬁbers is what causes \\nMS symptoms to occur.\\nBut MS is very rarely fatal ( life threatening) it is possible to live a fulﬁlling life with the \\ndisease. \\n2. Be Sure Your MS Diagnosis Is Deﬁnitive\\nVarious strategies are used to make a diagnosis of MS, including a neurological exam, MRI, \\nspinal ﬂuid analysis (spinal tap), and blood tests to rule out other conditions.\\nIn some cases, getting a deﬁnitiv e MS diagnosis can take quite some time, partly because \\nother causes of neurological symptoms must also be ruled out.\\nAccording to the latest criteria, your physician must do all the following to make an MS \\ndiagnosis:\\n·\\x00\\x00Find evidence of damage in two separ ate areas of the centr al nerv ous system\\n·\\x00\\x00Find evidence that the incidents of damage occurred at different points in time\\n·\\x00\\x00Rule out all other possible look alik e diseases and diagnoses\\n3. Understand That MS Symptoms Can Be Unpredictable \\nNo two people have exactly the same MS symptoms, and you may have different \\nsymptoms from time to time. Common MS symptoms include numbness or tingling, \\nspasticit y, vision problems, walking difﬁculties, weakness, slurred speech, fatigue, bladder \\ndysfunction, cognitiv e changes, and more. But these symptoms can be unpredictable.\\n“Over the course of the disease, some MS symptoms will come and go, while others may be \\nlong-lasting,\" Dr. Reder says.\\n3', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 266}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='4. Don\\'t Delay MS Treatment\\nBecause permanent neurological damage can happen even in the earliest stages of MS, it\\'s \\nimportant to start treatment as early as possible\\n \"All disease-modif ying therapies for MS (DMTs) may reduce chances of the disease \\nbecoming progressiv e,\" says Dr Reder.\\nThere are quite a few FDA-appro ved disease-modif ying therapies for MS that have been \\nfound to reduce the number of relapses, slow the progression of disabilit y, and limit new \\ndisease activity. These medications for MS include injectable medications, oral \\nmedications, and infused medications.\\nOther medications are also used to treat MS symptoms including bladder and bowel \\nsymptoms, depression, dizziness and vertigo , emotional changes, fatigue, itching, pain, \\nsexual changes, spasticit y, tremors, and walking (gait) difﬁculties.\\n5. Track Your MS Symptoms\\nKeeping a record of your MS symptoms and how you are feeling can help you update your \\ndoctor on your progress. Tracking your symptoms can also help you prepare a claim for \\ndisabilit y beneﬁts, if necessary . It can also help you stay on top of your symptoms if you\\'re \\nexperiencing memory problems or having trouble making connections, says Reder.\\n6. Avoid MS Symptom Triggers\\nCertain triggers, like stress, lack of sleep, infections, viruses, and hot baths or anything \\nelse that can lead to overheating, can cause a tempor ary worsening of MS symptoms, says \\nReder.Drinking alcohol in excess is discour aged for people with MS because intoxication \\ncauses poor coordination and slurred speech, which can add to existing MS symptoms, he \\nsays.\\n7. Find the Right Doctor for You\\nMS is a lifelong disease, so it\\'s important to be under the care of an MS specialist who is a \\ngood match for you. The neurologist who provided your initial MS diagnosis may not be the \\nspecialist you want to stick with for life.\\nMSSI  can help you locate neurologists in your area with expertise in treating MS. Support \\ngroups for people with MS are also helpful for getting doctor referr als suited to your \\ncircumstances.\\n8. Consider Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)\\nIn addition to taking medication to control your MS symptoms, you may want to consider \\ncomplementary and alternativ e treatments.\\nResearch is beginning to support the role of some CAM treatments in comprehensiv e MS \\ncare, including vitamin D, Yoga & exercise, acupuncture, and cooling strategies.

If you have to stop working or begin working from home, that can impact the \\ndynamic in your family , too. Navigating this new territory takes time and patience-both with \\nyourself and your loved ones.\\nYour Family Relationships\\nA good rule of thumb with MS and family relationships is: Don\\'t assume anything. Talk to \\nyour family about how much help you want and what you\\'d like to do for yourself . If there are \\nways you want to maintain your independence, let your loved ones know.\\nMake sure you are taking care of yourself , and encour age your family members to do the \\nsame.

Finding \\nways to carve out \"MS free\" zones or time can help give everyone a break. Look for ways to \\ntake the MS out of family life; reserv e time, money , and even actual physical space in your \\nhome where you all can focus on the present moment.

Friends, or our \"chosen family ,\" can provide \\ninvaluable support when you have MS. But even a well-meaning friend can say or do the \\nwrong thing at times.\\nTo keep your friendships strong, let your friends know what you need from them. Maybe you \\nneed someone to just hang out with you and chat or do something you both enjoy. Or maybe \\nyou need a speciﬁc type of help, such as being picked up for an outing if you can\\'t drive.

       " Document(page_content='FACTS Vs MYTHS\\nThe rapidly developing  science behind multiple sclerosis (MS) changes so fast that people \\nwith the condition, their families, and even their doctors can be forgiv en for not knowing all \\nof the latest news about it. But holding on to outdated myths and misconceptions about the \\ndisease may mean limiting your activities unnecessarily or missing out on the best \\ntreatments. With more accur ate, up-to-date knowledge of MS, people who live with it can \\nhave a higher qualit y of life. Here are some of the most common MS myths-and the truth \\nabout each one.\\nMyth 1: People With Multiple Sclerosis Can\\'t or Shouldn\\'t Be Physically Active \\nFact:  At one time, experts believ ed that physical activit y would worsen multiple sclerosis, \\nso they advised against an active lifestyle. Doctors now know that staying active is one of \\nthe best ways to stay health y with MS and delay disabilit y. Dr. Conway a neurologist at the \\nCleveland Clinic in Ohio, encour ages his MS patients to exercise regularly . \"In my \\nexperience, it can make fatigue worse at ﬁrst, but if a person can get over the initial hump , it \\ncan actually impro ve fatigue”\\nStudies have found that exercising regularly signiﬁcantly reduced fatigue in people with MS.  \\nThe authors concluded that a regular exercise routine is \"strongly recommended\" as part of \\nan overall MS management progr am.\\nTo get the most beneﬁts from exercise, choose activities that suit your interests and your \\nphysical abilities, and make sure you\\'re active on most days of the week. If you\\'re not sure \\nhow to get started with exercise, or you need some help identif ying exercises that will \\nimpro ve your ﬁtness without wearing you out, try working with a physical therapist or a \\npersonal trainer who is knowledgeable about MS.\\nMyth 2: Multiple Sclerosis Doesn\\'t Cause Pain \\nFact: Many people living with multiple sclerosis can tell you the truth about this MS myth: \\nThey do feel pain. Though some healthcare providers may not consider pain a symptom of \\nMS , Multiple sclerosis clearly does cause pain. A  study published in July 2017 in \\nScandina vian Journal of Pain conﬁrmed that people with multiple sclerosis not only \\nexperience long-term chronic pain but also report increased pain over time. \\nThere are three main causes of pain in MS - These include neuropathic pain, pain related to \\nspasticit y, and musculosk eletal pain due to immobilit y and fatigue.\\nBecause chronic pain in MS can present differently from one person to the next, it can be \\nespecially hard to treat, but it\\'s important that it\\'s addressed, says Dr. Anna PhD, associate \\nprofessor of physical medicine and rehabilitation \"People with MS need help with their pain,\" \\nshe says. Unfortunately , there isn\\'t a silver bullet that works for all chronic pain problems. \\n\"You may need to try a few different things, often in combination, to ﬁnd out what works for \\nyou\".\\nMyth 3: I Can\\'t Do Anything to Help My MS \\nFact:  There are many steps people with MS can take to impro ve their qualit y of life and \\npossibly slow the progression of the disease. Not smoking, being at a health y weight, \\nexercising regularly , and making sure you aren\\'t deﬁcient in vitamin D have all been shown \\nto help people with MS manage their condition.\\n13', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 276}),\n",

While these medications don\\'t \\ncure MS, they can reduce the number of relapses a person has and help slow the progression \\nof the disease later on. If you\\'re feeling powerless over your multiple sclerosis, talk to your \\nmedical team about others you can take.\\nMyth 4: I Can\\'t Work With MS \\nFact:  MS is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 45, a time in life when most \\npeople are working on building a career . Although MS progresses differently in everyone, \\nsymptoms such as fatigue and trouble concentr ating can eventually make a keeping a \\ntraditional job difﬁcult: It\\'s estimated that 70 percent of people with multiple sclerosis leave \\ntheir job within 10 years of their diagnosis.\\nEven though it is sometimes necessary to leave your job, continuing to work can have many \\nbeneﬁts besides the regular salary !\\nWe know that MS affects women more than men, and when we study women-not just \\nwomen with MS- who are in the workforce, they v alue their work less because of prestige \\nand the ﬁnancial gain. For them, it\\'s more about their self-esteem and identit y-even their \\nmain social support. \\nIf you are currently working or looking for a job, do some research about what would enable \\nyou to continue working before you quit your job or give up your job search. For example, if \\nfatigue is an issue, ask your emplo yer about accommodations such as ﬂexible working \\nhours or the possibilit y of working from home. The Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 \\nprotects your right to stay emplo yed and requires your emplo yer to work with you on \\nreasonable accommodations.\\nMyth 5: Multiple Sclerosis Is Not Associated With Cognitive Impairment \\nFact:  Multiple sclerosis is t ypically thought of as a condition that affects mobilit y, but the \\nfact is that it can also affect your cognitiv e functioning, such as thinking and memory .\\nHow much MS impacts your cognitiv e abilities can vary from person to person, Some people \\nwith MS have no deﬁcits or difﬁculties, , whereas others have brain fog symptoms, such as \\ndifﬁcult y with short-term memory , multitasking, or concentr ation.\\nThis could be due to inﬂammatory activit y in the brain, but there could be other causes as \\nwell. We can now screen for other things that could be contributing, including  vitamin \\ndeﬁciencies or the medications the person is using. F or example, sometimes medications \\nfor neuropathic pain can affect cognitiv e abilities.\\nMyth 6: Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Should Start With Less Powerful Drugs \\nFact:  \"The highest risk of developing irreversible problems is right after you are diagnosed,\"  \\nsays Dr Corbo y. In spite of that, some people with MS-and their doctors-prefer to begin \\ntreatment with drugs that are less powerful and have fewer side effects. He attributes this to \\na cultur al preference for waiting and seeing how things progress, an approach that could be \\nharmful for those with multiple sclerosis. A  study  found that, in people with relapsing-\\nremitting MS, initial treatment with the highly effectiv e disease-modif ying therapies \\nﬁngolimod, alemtuzumab , or natalizumab was associated with a lower risk of conversion to \\nsecondary -progressiv e MS, compared with people who started on the lower -efﬁcacy drugs \\nglatimer acetate or interferon beta.\\n14', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 277}),\n",

Correct information can \\nbe the key to helping families understand and cope with cognitiv e problems.\\nFatigue is another misunderstood invisible symptom of MS. Often a family member with MS \\nappears to lack motiv ation when, in fact, the person is experiencing MS fatigue, a type of \\ntiredness or exhaustion that is a symptom of the disease.\\nWhen the family has a clear understanding of fatigue and its impact on the person\\'s ability to \\nfunction, they may be more keen to help with household tasks, reconsider family activities \\nthat may be strenuous for the member with MS, and, in gener al, re-organise the house and \\nhabits of the family in a way that helps the person with MS to conserv e energy . It is \\nimportant for the family to understand the importance of energy conserv ation strategies \\nthat can help the person with MS have more energy to spend with the family .\\nHow families cope\\nEach member of a family has his or her own coping style. On ﬁnding out that a family \\nmember has MS, some people look for as much information about the disease as they can \\nﬁnd and perhaps prefer to talk to others about their experience with MS.\\nOthers may deal with news of the diagnosis by keeping busy with other activities in order to \\navoid thinking about MS.\\nEach person brings into the \"MS experience\" his or her own way of coping. Different coping \\nstyles within the same family can be complementary or contradictory . Contr adictory coping \\nstyles may lead to conﬂict within the family .\\nFamily members should be encour aged to cope with MS in their own individual styles, while \\nrespecting the coping styles of other members. Howev er, communication is the key, and if a \\nfamily traditionally has dealt with problems by ignoring them, assigning blame or using \\nsome other, ineffectiv e coping style, the family\\'s way of confronting MS will be the same, at \\nleast without the help of a family counsellor or psychologist.\\nMS can add stress to a relationship . The unpredictabilit y and progressiv e nature of the \\ndisease, the changes and sacriﬁces that might be required and the impact of some \\nsymptoms are all obstacles that make it difﬁcult for both the person with MS and their \\npartner to cope. It may be useful for a couple to seek help from a counsellor .\\nMS affects every member of the family . Learning about the disease and its possible effect on \\nthe family can help people face challenges as they arise. Families that are informed about \\nthe different resources available can choose those that best suit their needs and lifestyle.\\n16', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 279}),\n",

Even \\nif you\\'ve grown to accept your \"new normal,\" that doesn\\'t necessarily make it any easier . \\nLearning about the additional challenges that may come along and how to navigate them \\ncan make a huge difference in qualit y of life, both for you and those around you.\\nThe following tips, tools, and resources can help you to live well with multiple sclerosis.\\nManaging Daily Life and Complications of MS\\nTo stay health y when you have MS, it\\'s crucial to pay attention to your symptoms and how \\nyour body feels. Pushing too hard for too long can lead to a worsening of symptoms or even \\na ﬂare-up , or relapse. But adhering to a health y lifestyle can be easier said than done when \\nmany of the challenges of MS-lack of mobilit y, ﬁnancial strains, or even depression- make it \\neven harder to do what you know you should do. Figuring out what works for you-and what \\ndoesn\\'t -can help you live your best life with MS.\\nHealthy Eating Habits \\nIt\\'s a good idea to discuss any speciﬁc dietary changes you\\'d like to make with your doctor; \\nsome popular diets could have a negativ e impact on MS. Currently , the diet recommended \\nfor MS is similar to what\\'s recommended for everyone: lots of ﬁber, fruits, and vegetables, \\nand limits on the amounts of unhealth y fats and sugar you eat. \\nStaying at a health y weight is important for everyone, but that\\'s particularly true if you have \\nMS. Obesit y (severely over weight) can increase your risk of fatigue and depression, and \\nobesit y in children and teens has been associated with an increased risk of MS later in life.\\nHow food can impro ve or worsen various chronic illnesses is a growing area of research. \\nAlthough some people with MS may experience symptom relief when they eliminate or add \\ncertain foods to their diet, there\\'s no evidence yet that any particular diet can affect disease \\nprogression in MS. Almost all of us know what foods to eat & what to avoid. \\nFollow the Golden Rule of Moder ation: Avoid sugars, avoid excessiv e fatty & fried foods, \\nreduce your intake of carboh ydrates & cereals, eat ﬁber rich foods, fruits & vegetables rich in \\nproteins & miner als. \\nWe need not start searching for exotic fruits and unfamiliar foods like quinoa etc. In India, \\nour own traditional foods & some regional foods provide adequate health y options. \\nThere are no do\\'s & don\\'ts with regard to cereals or milk products or certain foods, unless \\nthe individual has medically proven restrictions like dairy or gluten allergies or suffers from \\ndiabetes. \\nManaging Your Prescriptions for MS\\nWhen it comes to medication to treat MS, there are more options than ever before- \\ncurrently , there are 20 appro ved disease-modif ying therapies. Once you\\'re diagnosed and \\nyou and your neurologist decide the best medication for your situation, you\\'ll want to start \\ntreatment as soon as possible. \"Whether you have a slowly or rapidly progressing form of \\nMS, a disease-modif ying therapy will reduce the relapse rate by up to 50 percent,\" says \\nMichael Hutchinson, MD, PhD, an associate clinical professor of neurology at Mount Sinai in \\nNew York City. Once your doctor decides what therapy is right for you, you\\'ll be shown the \\ncorrect way to take your medicine.

I'm 29, live in Delhi and I was \\ndiagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in 2009 at \\nthe age of 19.\\nIt's quite a funny thing when you're diagnosed \\nwith an incurable disease that leaves you looking \\nfine on the outside but wreaks havoc on the inside.\\nYour brain controls your body through nerve \\nimpulses, and MS attacks the nerves that send \\nthose messages. This, in turn, alters how your \\nbody functions. So, I'm sure you can imagine just \\nhow incon venient this disease is.\\nThe incon venience of this disease continues with involuntary muscle spasms. I've kicked \\npeople under tables, tipped m y coffee on people, and look ed lik e I was auditioning for a \\nhorror movie in the middle of the shopping center . I also look like I'm part of a zombie \\napocalypse on the regular from the horrific fatigue it causes.\\nJokes aside, an MS diagnosis is a lot to handle, especially at the young age of 19. Here are \\nall of the things I wish I knew sooner . \\nI want to share 6 points so that we can live with MS with better resilience.\\n1. Treatment will help\\nWhen I w as first diagnosed with MS , there weren't man y forms of treatment a vailable. I \\nhad to inject myself four times a week while not being able to feel the right side of my body.\\nI used to cry for hours, not being able to inject myself with medication because I'd \\nanticipate the pain. I wish I could go back and tell that girl who would sit with the injector on \\nher leg-which was covered in welts and bruises from the needles-that treatment would \\ncome so far that you won't have to inject yourself anymore. And it has come with \\nintroduction of oral DMTs. Even very reasonable generic drugs are available which are now \\nvery popular . It'd impro ve me so much that I'd regain the feeling in my face, arm, and leg.\\n2. Strength comes from challenges\\nI wish I knew that you learn your greatest strengths when you're faced with the worst of \\nlife's challenges.\\nI experienced mental and physical pain from injecting myself, I've lost feeling in my limbs, \\nand I've lost overall control of my body. Out of these things, though, I learned my greatest \\nstrengths. No university degree could teach me my strengths, but the worst of life's \\nchallenges could.\\nI have a resilience that can't be beat, and I have a smile that doesn't fade. I've experienced \\nreal darkness, and I know how lucky I am, even on a bad day.\\n3. Join support groups\\nI wish I could tell myself that I absolutely need support, and it's more than OK to accept it \\nand ask for it.\\nMy family are my absolute everything. They're the reason I fight so hard to be well, and \\nthey help me with cooking, cleaning, or gardening. I didn't want to burden my family with \\nmy fears, though, so I turned to an occupational therapist that specializ es in MS and never \\nlooked back. Being able to talk to someone other than my family helped me really accept \\nthe cards I'd been dealt and deal with the emotions I was feeling.

No two \\npeople with MS will share the same exact symptoms and experiences.\\nInstead, ﬁnd a communit y to share your concerns and ﬁnd support. Surround yourself with \\nthose who understand exactly what you're going through.\\n5. Everyone copes in different ways\\nAt ﬁrst, my way of coping was to pretend that I was ﬁne, even though I became a ﬁgure of \\nmyself that I didn't recogniz e. I stopped smiling and laughing and buried my head in my \\nstudies because that was the best way I knew how to cope. I didn't want to burden anyone \\nwith my illness, so I lied and told everyone I loved I was ﬁne.\\nI lived like this for many years until one day I realiz ed I couldn't do it alone anymore, so I \\nasked for help. Since then, I can truly say I've found my way of living well with MS.\\nI wish I knew that coping is different for everyone. It'll happen natur ally and at its own pace.\\nOne day, you'll look back and know you're the strong warrior  you are today because you \\nwalked through that war and continue to ﬁght that battle. You'll come out stronger and wiser \\neach time, ready to conquer again.\\n6. Everything will be OK\\nI wish that my 19-year-old self knew to truly believ e that everything would be OK. I would'v e \\nsaved so much stress, worry , and tears.\\nBut I know it's all about the process.

Here\\'s how \\nto know if it may be time for a change.\\nMost people who have multiple sclerosis (MS) are ﬁrst diagnosed with a type called \\nrelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), marked by deﬁned episodes of increased nervous system \\nsymptoms and impairment followed by periods of remission. Currently , nearly all people \\nwho have RRMS are treated with a class of drugs called disease-modif ying therapies \\n(DMTs). DMTs help reduce relapses, delay the progression of MS, and prevent future nerve \\ndamage, but they don\\'t impro ve existing damage or alleviate symptoms.\\nThere are now over two dozen DMTs used to treat MS, so there are a lot of options to choose \\nfrom. \"There is no one best disease-modif ying therapy for everyone,\" says Barbar a Giesser \\nMD, a neurologist and MS specialist at Saint John\\'s Health Center in Santa Monica, \\nCalifornia. \"Choosing a DMT is not an easy conversation between the patient and the \\nneurologist. You have to consider a number of factors.\" This includes how aggressiv e your \\nMS is and any other health conditions you have, as well as your lifestyle, ﬁnancial condition \\nand personal preferences. DMTs can be administered by mouth, injection, or intravenous \\n(IV) infusion.\\nUnlike, say, a headache medication that pro vides immediate relief , DMT s can tak e man y \\nmonths to start working. \"These treatments don\\'t make people feel better , and they don\\'t \\ntreat symptoms,\" Dr. Giesser says. Instead, DMTs are designed to lessen the immune \\nsystem\\'s attack on the nervous system, which can help decrease the number of ﬂares you \\nexperience and their severity.\\nThe effectiv eness of a DMT is primarily assessed by how well it reduces ﬂares and whether \\nyour doctor can see new or inﬂamed lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most \\npeople with MS require therapy with a DMT along with other medications or strategies to \\nhelp manage symptoms.\\nBut you probably won\\'t be on the same DMT forever. There are many reasons you might \\neventually change to a different treatment, and switching is common.\\n26', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 289}),\n",

A physical therapist or specially \\ntrained exercise professional can share speciﬁc exercises designed to impro ve foot drop, \\nwalking, balance, and going from sitting to standing.\\nIt's also possible to increase your strength, ﬂexibilit y, and level of ﬁtness when you have \\nMS. Although exercise can lead to soreness and fatigue, working with an expert can help \\nensure you don't overdo it. A regular progr am that builds your strength and stamina can \\nactually help reduce fatigue in the long run.\\nTaking measures not to get overheated during exercise is also important for individuals \\nwith MS, because getting too hot can cause MS symptoms to worsen. Some options for \\navoiding overheating include exercising in an air-conditioned environment, exercising \\noutside during the cooler parts of the day, and taking breaks to cool off during workouts. \\nWe also recommend keeping a bowl of cold water & a wet face towel by your side while \\nexercising.. dip it, squeez e it and wipe your forehead, neck arms & under arms with it \\nfrequently to bring down your body temper ature\\n28\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 291}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"MOBILITY ACCESSIBILITY AND MS\\nFor some people, the impact of MS on balance and leg strength can make getting around a \\nchallenge; many people with MS eventually need to rely on a walker, scooter , or wheelchair \\nin their home. Outﬁtting your living space to accommodate your assistiv e device may mean \\nmodif ying areas like your entryw ay, kitchen, and bathroom.\\nIf you aren't quite ready for a home modiﬁcation project, just clearing away clutter and \\nremoving decor ative accessories like rugs or baskets and ﬂowerpots can go a long way in \\ncreating space and helping to prevent falls.\\nMobility Aids for MS\\nFatigue and balance issues are common in MS, and eventually you might opt to use a \\nmobilit y aid. It is a good idea to get professional evaluation with a physical therapist who can \\nhelp you select the device that's right for your needs. There are many options to consider:\\n·\\x00\\x00Canes / Walking Sticks: There are two main types of canes: a single point cane; and a \\nfour-point cane, in which four pegs connect to the main shaft. Some people even choose to \\nuse two canes, one in each hand.\\n·\\x00\\x00Walkers  A walker is a good choice if you notice that you're beginning to stumble more.    \\nA standard walker has rubber grips on the bottom to help with stabilit y.\\n·\\x00\\x00Rollators  Instead of ﬂat rubber grips on the bottom, rollators (as the name suggests) \\nhave wheels on the bottom.\\n·\\x00\\x00Trekking poles  These devices are good for people with balance issues, as they \\nencour age a more upright posture compared with a cane.\\nSome people with MS resist or put off using a walking aid, but it can actually impro ve your \\nindependence and take some of the stress out of getting from here to there. If you have MS, \\nwhether to use a wheelchair or not can be a big decision. It may mean that your disease has \\nprogressed to the point where you don't feel safe getting around using other mobilit y \\ndevices. But it's not an all-or-nothing choice; many people decide to use a wheelchair for \\ncertain activities or environments but not full-time.\\nThere are manual wheelchairs, which require arm strength or others where someone is \\nrequired to push you, and powered scooters and wheelchairs, which move automatically \\nwith buttons or levers you can control.\\nAlthough many people - specially young persons- avoid using a wheelchair because they do \\nnot want to appear disabled or dependent , using one can actually provide freedom and new \\nopportunities for activities that aren't feasible with a cane or a walker. Just like we do not \\nhesitate to use specs if our eyesight gets weak, we should consider using a wheelchair if our \\nlegs are weak and it stops us from going out comfortably . \\nTravelling With MS\\nYou might think that because MS can ﬂare up unexpectedly amid stress, fatigue, heat, or an \\ninfection, travelling would be off-limits, but that's not the case. Most people with multiple \\nsclerosis have no travel restrictions, says a neurologist who specializ es in MS at Cleveland \\nClinic.\\nThere are things you can do to raise the chances that your trip goes smoothly . For one, make \\nsure you have all the medication you need, and don't forget to bring a way to store it at the \\nneeded temper ature. Bring any relevant medical information, and check ahead to see if \\nthere is medical care available at your destination. Finally , build in extra time to take breaks, \\nand schedule activities so you don't have to rush or be stressed during your journey .\\n29\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 292}),\n",

Doctors have to base a lot of their management advice on what patients self-\\nreport.\\nYour doctor may ask you to keep a diary record of your bowel symptoms, along with what \\nyou\\'re eating and drinking, and other potentially relevant behaviors. Patterns related to \\nwhat you eat or drink may emerge, and your doctor will also get a picture of your overall \\ndiet.\\nHow Diet and Medication Can Contribute to Bowel Problems\\n\"I don\\'t think people realiz e that the food we eat and what we drink can really make a \\ndifference in bowel symptoms\", says Rachael Stacom, an adult nurse practitioner and  at \\nIndependence Care System in New York City.\\nNot consuming enough ﬁber or ﬂuids can contribute to constipation, while consuming spicy \\nfoods, dairy products, caffeine, and artiﬁcial sweeteners can all lead to problems with \\nbowel urgency .\\nIn more difﬁcult cases, it ma y help to follow a v ery restricted diet to see what foods \\nmight be problematic, she sa ys. Then, \"we\\'ll ha ve people slowly introduce foods to see \\nif that aggr avates or upsets y our stomach.\"\\nAnother potential contributor to both constipation and urgency is what kinds of medication \\nyou take. Some may have a stimulant effect or bother your stomach, leading to bowel \\ncontractions. Others may slow down your digestion, leading to constipation- and possibly a \\nhigher risk of incontinence.\\nAdjusting medication doses may be difﬁcult, especially if they\\'re working to reliev e some \\nother symptoms. But sometimes there are some easy things we can do, such as adjusting \\ndiet and a bathroom schedule to respond to the effects of the medication.\\nMedical Interventions for Bowel Incontinence in MS.\\nCertain drugs can be helpful to manage constipation and bowel incontinence, often in \\ncombination with a bowel training routine. \"Sometimes the key is to get your bowels on a \\nregular schedule,\" says Kaplan.\\nOne technique involves taking a laxativ e powder or syrup  at the same time each day. If \\nsomeone can establish having a bowel movement routinely after breakfast, then that \\nmeans for the rest of the day they might be free of the fear that they might have an \\naccident.\\nThere are many other drugs to  as stool softeners and stimulants like bisacodyl and senna. \\nBut many of them should be used very carefully , since they can have side effects and their \\neffectiv eness may decrease as you develop a tolerance to them.\\nAnother useful option for many people with bowel incontinence is glycerin suppositories-\\nwhich you insert into your rectum to induce a bowel movement, usually within 10 minutes. \\n\"They essentially help soften the stool that\\'s in the rectal area, and they\\'re not chemically \\nabsorbed,\" she explains. \"You can\\'t overdose on them.\"\\n41', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 304}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='If you know you\\'ll be going someplace-from a long car ride to a social function- where you \\ndon\\'t want to risk a bowel accident, you can use a suppository beforehand. \"I\\'ve had so \\nmany patients tell me that this w as so liber ating to them, because they could time their \\nown bowel movement and do it at their convenience,\" says Kaplan.\\nPelvic Floor PT and Other Solutions to Bowel Incontinence\\nMany patients beneﬁt from pelvic ﬂoor physical therapy, which may help strengthen both \\nyour pelvic ﬂoor muscles and y our anal sphincter -potentially addressing both bowel and \\nbladder problems. Some people need only one or two sessions with a therapist and can \\nthen do the exercises at home. When lifestyle measures and medication aren\\'t enough to \\ncontrol constipation or incontinence, transanal irrigation/ enema -using a device to ﬂush \\nout your rectum with water-may be an option, and has been shown to help reliev e \\nsymptoms in people with MS, according to a study published in April 2016 in the journal \\nNeurogastroenterology & Motilit y.\\nAnd if you still need protection from bowel accidents, wearing adult diapers can be helpful \\nfor many people with MS. Just remember that they\\'re \"not all created equal\" in terms of \\nabsorption. You should also apply a skin barrier , such as petroleum jelly or pure Vaseline , \\nto any area that may come into contact with your stool or urine especially if you spend most \\nof the day sitting in a wheelchair or have reduced sensation in the area.\\n\"Extreme constipation can lead to stool backup\" in the colon, Kaplan says-making it much \\nharder to control bowel movements when the inner anal sphincter ﬁnally opens and the \\npelvic ﬂoor relaxes to allow the muscles in the rectum to push the stool out.\\nBut some people with MS experience bowel incontinence without constipation, or without \\nknowing they\\'re constipated-especially if the outer anal sphincter isn\\'t functioning well.\\nBowel problems often go hand-in-hand with bladder problems, and not just because \\nthey\\'re both caused by a disruption in nerve signaling affecting the same region of your \\nbody. Often when someone has an overactive bladder , they try to self-treat by limiting their \\nﬂuid intake. That can, in turn, worsen constipation and, in some cases, lead to incontinence \\nor urine leaks.\\n10\\nTIMES\\n42', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 305}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"HEALTHY EATING HABITS FOR MS\\nMaking adjustments to your eating habits may help you better manage MS.\\nLet's face it-following a health y diet is important to your overall wellness. And many people \\nwith multiple sclerosis (MS) say that making the right food choices helps them live better \\nwith the disease, too.\\nIn fact, on Tippi MS, a social tool for sharing your go-to tips for living with MS, food is one of \\nthe most popular topics that people are talking about.\\nWhile an exact MS diet doesn't exist, choosing nutritious foods and cutting back on highly \\nprocessed foods can provide benefits like impro ving your energy level and reducing the \\nimpact of other symptoms. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Societ y (NMS S), \\ndiet could even play a role in disease progression.\\nTip No. 1: Start With Good Nutrition\\nBecause there's no specific diet for MS, navigating diet advice might seem confusing. But \\nquite simply , the best diet for MS may be to follow the same health y eating guidelines as \\neveryone else. The NMSS recommends eating a low-fat, high-fiber diet that focuses on real \\nfood (like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean protein) as opposed to processed foods \\nthat are high in salt, sugar , and other additiv es Follow a health y diet. No specific diet has \\nbeen shown (yet) to reduce MS progression. You will hear about all kinds of 'MS diets,' but \\nthe truth is that basic guidelines for a health y diet also apply to those of us with MS.  Mostly \\nplant-based is best for us (and our environment)! Aim for at least 5 servings of fruits and \\nveggies a day (the more, the better) , and also avoid red meat, saturated fat, highly \\nprocessed food, and limit alcohol.\\nDon't get caught up in the diet game! Eat plenty of (organic) fruits and vegetables and \\nlimited low-fat meats. Above all, try to maintain a consistent routine and eat around the \\nsame time every day. Eating at regular times keeps my energy steady .\\nTip No. 2: Reduce Processed Foods and Sugars\\nWhich foods are off -limits for MS? None, really , although some people who ha ve MS sa y \\nthat avoiding certain foods or even whole food groups impro ves their symptoms. Still, what \\nworks for them may not work for you.\\nIf you suspect that a particular food group , such as dairy products, or a component of some \\nfoods, such as gluten, is negativ ely affecting your health, speak to your doctor about it. In \\nsome cases, your doctor may be able to administer tests to determine whether you have an \\nintoler ance or allergy to a food or food group .\\nIn other cases, your doctor may suggest trying an elimination diet, ideally under the \\nsupervision of a registered dietitian. The idea behind an elimination diet is to stop eating \\nfoods that may be triggering an adverse reaction in your body for two or more weeks, then \\nslowly reintroduce them, one by one, to identif y how each food makes you feel. \\n43\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 306}),\n",

She recognises \\nalmost all of the members and knows their personal details so that when \\nthey call for help she knows what to do. Often it is just to lend a patient ear \\nto their anxieties, although she has loads of work to do.  \\nShashi arranges Physiother apy appointments and keeps track of all the \\nschedules and payments.. that is a lot of work when there are 12-14 \\nphysiother apists visiting 45 MSps adding up to almost 500 calls a month! She also \\nprepares all the data charts for the Scholarship project as well as that of the Home \\nAttendant ! Phew! \\nShashi's strength lies in her ability to interact with all the MSP's who call up the office and \\ncome to the events held by us. She responds smilingly and with patience and makes sure \\nthat all queries are followed up and dealt with in time for our monthly reviews.\\nShashi lives very close to the office in Shahpur Jat, and starts her day at 8 am – She works \\ntill the afternoon, so that she can be home in time to look after her young son (who is now in \\nClass 12) , her home &  ageing father in law before her husband returns from his office in \\nthe suburbs. It's not easy being a working woman !  \\nWe really appreciate her quiet dedication & smiling countenance. \\nRAJKUMAR:  \\nRaj Kumar is not only a Jack of all tr ades, he is indeed a master of man y \\ntalents as well !  Enthusiastic and self driv en,  he has been with MS SI \\nDelhi since 2009. There is nothing that he cannot do–making pa yments, \\nhandling the utilit y billing, chasing the bank; sitting with our accountant \\nto cross tally the bank entries, handle all the post & courier , arrange \\npacking & shipping of the medicinal supplements; mak e sure that all the \\ncourier receipts ha ve come back, supervise ofﬁce repairs & maintenance, \\n, do the back end work during our ev ents, ﬁling, copying and collating all reports when \\nwe ha ve our monthly EC Meetings at the ofﬁce – and all this with a smile on his face!\\nHis family - his wife and two sons (Class 8 and Class 5) live close by in Chirag Dilli. His ever-\\nfaithful bike is his steed and he has traversed throughout the Delhi and NCR region on it to \\ncomplete all our outdoor jobs.OUR STARS SHINE BRIGHT ! \\nVery few people realise the tremendous role played by the back-ofﬁce staff of any \\norganisation. This is even more true at MSSI Delhi. Though all of you remember just a \\ncouple of names because they have been there for many years , the truth is nothing works \\nwithout teamwork. MSSI Delhi's not-so-visible, members are the strong silent pillars of the \\nworkforce, and the backbone of our team. \\nAll our MSp's who have attended our events or have called up the ofﬁce for any queries or \\nassistance are familiar with the names of Shashi, Rajkumar and of course Puja! \\nToday, let's tell you something about all of them.\\n52\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 315}),\n",

Puja has studied Hotel \\nManagement and went on to complete a degree in Law, so she brings many \\nskills to her role. \\n Her upbringing as an \"Army brat \" ensured she is game for any kind of work-with discipline, \\npunctualit y & dedication! As she happily says–\"she can do anything and everything\". \\nBeing a self starter , she began by looking after the social media but soon became an asset \\nin Office Management. The systems and data were taken over by her to be updated and \\nupdated & updated!  We now have all our MIS streamlined & are able to access almost all of \\nit in real time. \\nShe is mother to Purab, her 18 year old , and an absolutely delightful young lady Chahat \\nwho is now 10.

It is thought to be\\nan immune-mediated disorder, in which the immune sy stem incorrectly attacks\\nhealthy tissue in the CNS.\\nMS can cause many symptoms, including blurred visio n, loss of balance, poor\\ncoordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, ex treme fatigue, problems with\\nmemory and concentration, paralysis, and blindness and more. These problems may\\ncome and go or persist and worsen over time. Most p eople are diagnosed between the\\nages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as  2 and as old as 75 have developed\\nit.\\nAbout MS\\nBecause MS causes damage in the CNS, nearly any fun ction can be adversely a\\x00ected.\\nHowever, the most common symptoms are overwhelming fatigue, visual disturbances,\\naltered sensation and di\\x00culties with mobility.\\nSymptoms of MS are unpredictable, and vary in type and severity from one person to\\nanother and in the same person over time. Symptoms may disappear or remit\\ncompletely or they may persist and may worsen over time.\\nWho gets MS?\\nAnyone may develop MS but there are some patterns. More than two to three times as\\nmany women as men develop MS and this gender di\\x00ere nce has been increasing over\\nthe past 50 years. Studies suggest that genetic ris k factors increase the risk of\\ndeveloping MS, but there is no evidence that MS is directly inherited. Environmental\\nfactors, such as low Vitamin D and cigarette smokin g have also been shown to increase\\nthe risk of MS. MS occurs in most ethnic groups, in cluding African-Americans, Asians\\nand Hispanics/Latinos, but is most common in Caucas ians of northern European\\nancestry.\\nTypes of\\xa0MS\\nFour disease courses have been identi\\x00ed in multipl e sclerosis: clinically isolated\\nsyndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), prim ary progressive MS (PPMS), and\\nsecondary progressive MS (SPMS).\\nCan MS be cured?\\nNot yet. There are now FDA-approved medications tha t have been shown to “modify”\\nthe course of MS by reducing the number of relapses  and delaying progression of\\ndisability to some degree. In addition, many therap eutic and technological advances\\nare helping people manage symptoms.

       " Document(page_content='Home  » Advocacy\\nAdvocacy\\nRights of Persons with Disabilities Act recognized MS as a disability in 2016. Yet, there are still se veral grave issues faced by people living with MS a nd their families. There are\\nseveral issues of persons with MS that need to be w orked out with RPDA 2016:\\n1. The issue of the 40% benchmark disability : As per the assessment guidelines released by the Government, Multiple Sclerosis will be assessed onl y as a percentage of\\nPermanent Physical Impairment. This may not be appl icable to all persons diagnosed with Multiple Scler osis as at times the disability is invisible such a s fatigue,\\nincontinence, imbalance, cognitive disorders etc. M S is also episodic in nature, so the regulating aut hority will have to evaluate the frequency and leng th of the episodes of\\nrelapse, the time between relapses, and the presenc e of permanent impairments even in times of little to no symptoms, associated conditions due to medica tions and the\\ndisorder itself etc to determine the disability of a person with MS accordingly. The Guidelines, there fore, need to be reworked in consultation with the primary stakeholders\\nto take into account invisible symptoms and the cri teria of visible 40% disability must be supplemente d with the previous relapses the MS person experien ced making for\\nthe poor quality of life and qualifying for persist ent disability. In addition, due to the multiple is sues faced by persons with MS, they need to be ackn owledged as people\\nhaving multiple disabilities.\\n2. Non-availability of data on people with MS in India : The crude prevalence of MS in India stands at 8-9  people per 1, 00,000. It is estimated that the app roximate number\\nof persons with MS in India is close to 1.8 lakh. 3 ,000 members are registered with the 8 MSSI chapter s in India. To date, no large-scale studies have be en conducted to\\naccurately determine the incidence and prevalence o f MS in India. However, in the last few years, an i ncrease in the number of practising neurologists an d easy and\\na\\x00ordable availability of magnetic resonance imagin g (MRI) has led to an increase in the reported prev alence of MS but there is no centralized Registry o f Person with MS in\\nthe country. Without authentic data, it is di\\x00cult to convince policymakers to formulate appropriate p olicies and programmes for people with MS and also for\\npharmaceutical companies to invest in Research and Development for treatment.\\n3. The prohibitive cost of treatment : As on date there is no cure for MS. A growing bod y of evidence indicates that early and ongoing trea tment with a Disease-Modifying\\nTherapy (DMT) is the best way to modify its course,  prevent the accumulation of disability, and protec t the brain from damage due to MS. Most branded DMT s are expensive\\nwhich makes treatment una\\x00ordable to most people in  a poor country like ours. Cost of treatment varies  from Rs 3 lakhs/year to 2 crores/year and can go o n for periods\\nanywhere between 2 years to lifelong. This rising c ost of drugs and changing insurance coverage advers ely a\\x00ect access to treatment for people with MS. T here is also scant\\nresearch on developing generic drugs to treat peopl e with MS in India.\\n4. Insurance cover not available for people with MS : People living with MS fall into an Impaired Risk Category to life insurance companies. Insurance com panies claim that\\nthough having MS makes it more di\\x00cult to get insur ed, many people with this condition have bought lif e insurance. This is a fallacy. Most people with MS  in India are\\ndenied insurance and the only options are those suc h as guaranteed graded bene\\x00t life insurance polici es that they can be approved if one has Primary Pro gressive Multiple\\nSclerosis or Secondary Progressive MS. These come a t high premiums falling in the Critical Illness Cat egories and that also is dependent upon the whims o f the', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 337}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Sclerosis or Secondary Progressive MS. These come a t high premiums falling in the Critical Illness Cat egories and that also is dependent upon the whims o f the\\nunderwriters.\\xa0 Most insurances do not cover MS as a  pre-existing condition; some insurers will cover M S medications, but have a 5 year wait period—a perso n with MS\\nmust be continuously insured by the insurer for 5 c onsecutive years as a precondition for coverage, th ereby leaving them with little option for accessing  their medications\\nat least initially. Added to that are \\x00nancial cost s associated with consultations, diagnostics, and d isability support among others. The lack of a fair and adequate system\\nleads to low participation in insurance schemes.\\n5. No reservation for people with MS in the job reserv ation quota of 4% as mandated by the RWPD Act:  While MS has been recognized as a disability under  the RPWD Act\\nit is disappointing that the Government has chosen to deny this group and a few others the advantage o f the allocated 4% reservation in Government jobs. There is a 1%\\nreservation each for people with low vision and bli ndness, deaf and hard of hearing, locomotor disabil ity, autism, intellectual disability, speci\\x00c learn ing disability and\\nmental illness.\\xa0 There is no reservation for people  living with MS as well as for people with various blood disorders recognized under the RPWD Act which  is discriminatory\\nin itself.\\n6. No implementation of the caregivers’ allowance and other provisions as promised under the RPWD Act : Section 24(3) of the RPWD Act clearly states that  the\\nappropriate Government shall within the limit of it s economic capacity and development formulate neces sary schemes and programmes to safeguard and promot e the\\nrights of persons with disabilities for an adequate  standard of living to enable them to live independ ently or in the community and that these shall incl ude:\\nfacilities for persons including children with disa bilities who have no family or have been abandoned,  or are without shelter or livelihood;\\nsupport during natural or man-made disasters and in  areas of con\\x00ict;\\nsupport to women with disability for livelihood and  for the upbringing of their children;\\naccess to safe drinking water and appropriate and a ccessible sanitation facilities especially in urban  slums and rural areas;\\nprovisions of aids and appliances, medicine and dia gnostic services and corrective surgery free of cos t to persons with disabilities with such income cei ling as may be\\nnoti\\x00ed;\\ndisability pension to persons with disabilities sub ject to such income ceiling as may be noti\\x00ed;\\nunemployment allowance to persons with disabilities  registered with Special Employment Exchange for mo re than two years and who could not be placed in an y\\ngainful occupation;\\ncare-giver allowance to persons with disabilities w ith high support needs;\\ncomprehensive insurance scheme for persons with a d isability, not covered under the Employees State In surance Schemes, or any other statutory or Governme nt-\\nsponsored insurance schemes;These schemes are extre mely important for people living with MS but even t hough two years have ended since the noti\\x00cation of  the\\nCentral Rules, most of these schemes are yet to be framed and we request that people with MS should al so be considered while framing these schemes. The i ncome\\nceiling as mentioned in 24.3.f and other provisions  of the act should be removed for persons with mult iple sclerosis considering the huge medical expense s incurred by\\nthem. In addition, medical assistance kits and moto rised wheelchairs should be added to social protect ion measures / high support provisions (sec 38) of persons with\\nMS.

       " Document(page_content='Tourism, Housing etc need to adopt a reasonable acc ommodation chart for people with MS and promote the  same.\\n7. Lack of authentic research on MS in India : There is an urgent need for research on people li ving with MS in India. Research is required in mult iple areas – data, therapy,\\ntreatment (stem cell, DMT), ways to improve Quality  of Life (QoL), genetic analysis, population-based studies, discrimination faced in job establishments / public\\nplaces/hospital setup and other investigations that  are steadily expanding scientists’ understanding o f MS risk factors and physiologic processes, laying  the groundwork for\\nnew treatments and other interventions. Issues of a ccess and adherence, along with healthcare outcomes  – Economic, Clinical and Humanistic outcomes for M S patients\\nliving in India–need to be further investigated for  a deeper understanding so that clinical programs m ay be optimized. Critical questions of access and a \\x00ordability remain,\\nmaking MS an expensive condition. In the absence of  drug databases and outcomes reporting in India, al l information procured is usually through patients or neurologists\\nwilling to discuss treatments.\\n8. Lack of awareness about Multiple Sclerosis:  In 2013 there were only 1200 neurologists register ed with the Indian Academy of Neurology – the numbe r may have\\nincreased marginally. There is therefore not much a wareness about MS in India among doctors and among the general public and it is important to sensitize  the larger\\npublic and also the medical fraternity on issues fa ced by persons with MS.\\xa0\\xa0Section 39 (1) of the RPWD  Act (1) mandates that the appropriate Government, in consultation\\nwith the Chief Commissioner or the State Commission er, as the case may be, shall conduct, encourage, s upport or promote awareness campaigns and sensitisa tion\\nprogrammes and awareness must also be created about  MS, its symptoms and information about various sup port organisations and hospitals supporting people living with\\nMS, the need for reasonable accommodations at educa tional institutions, job establishments and public places, particularly on India MS Day ( 1st Sunday o f February)\\nand/or on World MS Day on 30th May.\\n9. Challenges with education/ higher education for stu dents living with MS : MS manifests in di\\x00erent ways – fatigue and weakn ess coupled with the treatment itself causes\\nmany students diagnosed with MS to miss classes the reby impacting attendance. Most cases of MS are dia gnosed later in life when the person is pursuing hi gher education.\\nTherefore, as a reasonable accommodation for them, it is recommended that the attendance criteria shou ld be relaxed for students with MS for them to be a ble to prepare\\nfor and sit for their exams. Also, \\x00nancial support  should be o\\x00ered to children of people living with  MS as very often the disorder leads to a loss of e mployment and is\\ncoupled with a prohibitive \\x00nancial burden of treat ment.\\n10. Income tax exemptions : Currently three sections viz. 80-U, 80DD, 80 DDB of the Income Tax Act along with Rules 11A & 11DD o f IT Rules are relevant for persons with any\\ndisability and their immediate family members to cl aim any deductions under Income Tax. People with 40 % to 80% disability can avail a deduction of Rs 75, 000 to Rs 1.25\\nlakhs in a \\x00nancial year. However the de\\x00nition of disabilities are unfortunately as per the PwD Act o f 1995 and according to that, multiple sclerosis is  not a recognized\\ndisability. Section 80DD and Section 80U of the Inc ome Tax Act allows a deduction for the medical expe nses incurred for di\\x00erently-abled persons. The amo unt of\\ndeduction is the same for both sections. However, S ection 80DD can be claimed by the person who has in curred expenses for the dependent di\\x00erently-abled person.

Re search studies have\\nfound that people in the early stages of MS may exp erience changes in their walking ability, balance, and breathing. If ignored, these early signs can le ad to further disability. When\\nsomeone receives a diagnosis of MS, the best option  is to begin physical therapy right away to help im prove any mild challenges and possibly slow down th e progression of the\\nsymptoms of the disease.\\nPhysical therapists play an important role in the m anagement of MS throughout the disease course – at diagnosis, during and after relapses, during period s of progression as well as\\nperiods of stability, and when the disease becomes more advanced.\\nPhysiotherapy for MS involves exercises to strength en the muscles and improve gait (how you walk) and the balance and coordination. It also involves stre tches to help them\\nmaintain mobility and prevent muscle spasms. Physio therapy can also include training on how to use mob ility aids like a cane, walker, or wheelchair.\\nTo improve the mobility of poor and marginalised, M SSI provides home nursing care and physiotherapy su pport to the MS persons, who can’t a\\x00ord these serv ices.

MSSI play a b ridge role between\\nMS patients and the Neurologists to access better c onsultation and treatment. During Covid 19 pandemic , e\\x00orts are being made to provide online consultat ions services to the\\nMS persons to bridge the gap and maximise the direc t bene\\x00ts to MS persons.\\nMobility Aids  \\nProblems with walking can interfere with work, trav el, social events, and daily activities. Symptoms s uch as fatigue or spasticity can aggravate di\\x00culti es in getting around.\\nFortunately, many challenges with mobility can be a lleviated by using mobility aids. These can be as s imple as a cane or foot orthotic or as complex as a  power wheelchair or\\nadapted vehicle.In order to increase the mobility o f MS persons, MSSI provides the support of Wheelcha irs, Walkers, walking sticks to the low-income grou p MS persons, so that\\nthey could lead a normal life and can do their rout ine activities on daily basis.\\nComfort & Hygiene Aids  \\nMany people with MS experience a range of bladder p roblems, including urinary incontinence. Urinary in continence may range from occasional leaks when cou ghing or\\nsneezing to sudden urges to urinate throughout the day, sometimes leaking before making it to the bath room. Due to a combination of incontinence and limi ted mobility, many\\nMS person depends on hygiene aids. To reduce the bu rden of disease, MSSI support Hygiene products like  Diaper, catheters, toilet chairs, commode chairs a nd supplements to\\nthe MS person across 8 chapters in India.\\nYoga sessions  \\nYoga has the potential to lessen several physical s ymptoms of MS and may contribute to improved streng th, \\x00exibility, posture, balance, focus, circulatio n, digestion,\\nelimination, and pelvic \\x00oor health and to decrease d tension, fatigue, and spasticity.

Once the\\ndiagnosis is made, early and sustained treatment increases the chance of living well and lowers risk of\\nworsening disabilit y.\\nSince no simple blood test exists, multiple sclerosis can be challenging to diagnose. Sometimes an individual\\nhas classic symptoms and MRI scan findings, leading to a diagnosis within a few da ys. Other people ma y have\\nrecurrent symptoms for y ears that were attributed to other conditions. This section pro vides an o verview of\\nthe key elements of diagnosing MS .\\nFirst Symptoms\\nSince MS can affect the br ain, spinal cord or nerv es to the ey e (optic nerv es), v arious neurologic symptoms\\noccur. Some people only experience a few of these symptoms o ver their lifetime while others ha ve dealt with\\nnumerous symptoms. A t the beginning of the disease, appro ximately 85% of people living with multiple\\nsclerosis experience attacks (also called relapses or exacerbations) of neurological symptoms often lasting\\ndays to months. Individual attacks can be separ ated b y months or y ears.\\n1. Visual Problems\\nPoor vision out of one ey e often for da ys or weeks can be due to optic neuritis, often the first sign of\\nMS. Optic neuritis can be associated with pain with ey e movements at onset and reduced red-color\\nvision. Sometimes the visual impairment occurs only when o verheated called Uhtoff ’s phenomenon.\\nDouble vision due to impaired ey e movements is common. Other people described shaky vision due to\\na phenomenon called n ystagmus.\\n2. Numbness\\nNumbness, tingling, pins-needles, and burning sensations are commonly the first symptoms of MS .\\nNumbness in feet the rises up the legs to the pelvis o ver days is often due to tr ansverse m yelitis,\\nwhich can be due to MS affecting the spinal cord.

Constipation, urgent need to mo ve bowels, and bowel accidents can occur .\\nDecrease sensitivit y can lead to trouble achieving orgasm. Erectile dysfunction can occur for men.\\n8. Depression and Thinking Problems\\nDepression is common. Short -term memory loss and multi-tasking problems sometimes occur , even in\\nearly stages.\\nNeurological Examination\\nAn important part of the diagnosis is a thorough neurological exam. Thinking (cognitiv e) problems including\\nshort-term memory loss can be detected on a series of questions the doctors ma y ask. F or example,\\nremembering 3 objects at 5 minutes. Vision will be closely check ed including ey e movements. F acial sensation\\nand presence of facial droop will be ev aluated. Muscles in arms/legs will be examined for weakness and\\nstiffness. Often reflex es in MS are o veractive or brisk, r ather than lost. Scr atching the sole of the foot might\\ncause the big toe to go upw ards, called a Babinski sign. Decreased feeling to light touch, vibr ation and pin\\nprick sensation can occur in one or all limbs. Balance ma y be off , especially w alking one foot in front of\\nanother lik e on a tightrope.\\nMRI Imaging\\nThe k ey to diagnosing MS is primarily magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

The\\nspikes on the surface of this COVID-19 corona virus creates a “corona” (deriv ed from the latin word for\\ncrown).  The mRNA is surround b y a lipid (fatt y) nanoparticle that allows it to enter cells of the body when\\ninjected in the muscle.  Once mRNA is in the cells, the cells can create their own spik e proteins on their\\nsurface. The body’ s immune system that reacts to these foreign spik e proteins leading to immunit y with\\nmemory T and B cells.  These COVID-19 v accinations result in a robust immune response to this spik e protein\\nthat pro vides up to 95% immunit y from the real COVID-19 infection, caused b y the S ARS-CoV -2 virus.\\nThe Astr aZeneca and Sputnik V v accines use a t ype of virus called an adeno virus to insert DNA into the cell\\nnucleus.  The double-str anded DNA does not get into our own DNA, howev er.  The DNA str and allows the cell\\nto also mak e only the spik e protein.  The DNA in the adeno virus has been altered so the adeno virus lacks to\\nthe abilit y to replicate (divide) in the body .\\nDisease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs) and Response to Vaccines :\\nAll decisions regarding taking a v accine with multiple sclerosis should be made in consultation with y our\\nhealthcare pro viders.  \\nMultiple sclerosis medications can impact y our body’ s abilit y to mount an immune response to a v accine.

An ex citing approach is rem yelination,  a process in\\nwhich new m yelin is made.   The m yelin coating on nerv e cells allows messages to tr avel rapidly such as from\\nthe br ain down the spinal cord.  Loss of the m yelin coating can dela y or block the messages getting to where\\nthey need to go .  Chronic m yelin loss ma y actually cause some nerv e cells to slowly die.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 533}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Myelin is formed from cells called oligos (short for oligodendrocytes) that wr ap around and around multiple\\nnerve cells.  In MS , the immune system attacks m yelin, causing tempor ary or permanent m yelin loss.\\nIn the human br ain, 5-8% of cells ha ve the potential to grow -up to be m yelin-making oligos.   These\\nimmature cells are called OPCs (oligodendrocyte precursor cells).   So how do we get these OPCs to create\\nnew m yelin and repair old damage?  \\nOne step is trying to mak e more of these OPC s.   Growth factors, such as PDGF- AA, can stimulate the OPCs\\nto divide and multiply .   Another approach is attr acting the potential m yelin-making cells into the MS plaques. \\nSemaphorin- 3F , for example, is a protein that can attr act OPCs to areas of loss of m yelin. Chemokines are\\nother compounds that can help OPCs to mo ve into a plaque for rem yelination.\\nRemoving factors that block rem yelination is a another w ay to try to repair m yelin.   High lev els of LINGO-1 ,\\nfor example, prev ent OPCs from maturing and making m yelin.  An antibody to LINGO-1 allowed for\\nremyelination to occur in animal models and is now being tested in human clinical trials.

T lymphocytes target other cells such as cells\\ninfected with viruses or cancerous cells. They are called “T” cells since they mature in the th ymus gland in the\\nupper chest. Normally T cells that would attack our own cells are destro yed in the th ymus gland before being\\nreleased into the circulation. In autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, these T cells escape and can\\nlead to the immune attack on m yelin.\\nB cells mature in the bone marrow in humans, but were named after a specializ ed organ where B cells mature\\nin birds known as the bursa of F abricius. B cells can change into plasma cells which mak e antibodies.\\nAntibodies are lik e targeted arrows that can help attack germs such as viruses or bacteria that are in vading\\nour bodies. In multiple sclerosis, B cells turn against their human b y creating antibodies that attack m yelin\\nand revving up autoimmune T cells.\\nRole of T and B cells in Vaccination:\\nVaccines work b y imitating a serious infection. V accines can cause minor symptoms, but do not cause the\\nactual disease. The v accine triggers the dev elopment of specific -targeted T and B cells that remember the\\ninfection. When someone is then exposed to the real life-threatening virus or bacteria in the future, they can\\nmount a highly effectiv e defense against the infection due to these “memory” T and B cells. F or example,\\nchildren are v accinated with a weak ened, liv e chick en po x virus called the v aricella- zoster virus. The immune\\nsystem then dev elops T cells and antibodies specific for this v aricella virus. The v accine has been shown\\nreduce the risk of getting chick en po x later in life b y 92%. If someone is immunosuppressed, important to\\navoid liv e, weak ened (attenuated) viruses.\\nMost v accines are inactiv ated v accines which means they do not contain liv e viruses or bacteria. V accines that\\ninject killed whole virus include polio , hepatitis B and r abies.  Man y inactiv ated v accines include only sugar\\nmolecules (polysaccharides) that are found on the surface of bacteria or surface proteins that are found on\\nviruses. These components of the infectious agent lack the abilit y to replicate since they do not contain\\ndisease-spreading genetic material (RNA or DNA).', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 809}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='COVID-19 vaccines:\\nFor COVID-19, the Pfiz er and Moderna v accines are mRNA v accines. The mRNA contains instructions for our\\nown body to mak e a harmless “spik e” protein.  This spik e protein is on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. The\\nspikes on the surface of this COVID-19 corona virus creates a “corona” (deriv ed from the latin word for\\ncrown).  The mRNA is surround b y a lipid (fatt y) nanoparticle that allows it to enter cells of the body when\\ninjected in the muscle.  Once mRNA is in the cells, the cells can create their own spik e proteins on their\\nsurface. The body’ s immune system that reacts to these foreign spik e proteins leading to immunit y with\\nmemory T and B cells.  These COVID-19 v accinations result in a robust immune response to this spik e protein\\nthat pro vides up to 95% immunit y from the real COVID-19 infection, caused b y the S ARS-CoV -2 virus.\\nThe Astr aZeneca and Sputnik V v accines use a t ype of virus called an adeno virus to insert DNA into the cell\\nnucleus.  The double-str anded DNA does not get into our own DNA, howev er.  The DNA str and allows the cell\\nto also mak e only the spik e protein.

The adv antages of good disease control must be\\nbalanced against serious risks of these drugs ev en if some risks are uncommon or r are.\\nLemtr ada (alemtuzumab) is a highly effectiv e antibody ther apy that in clinical trials has  reduced relapses b y\\nhalf compared to R ebif. On Lemtr ada, 43% of patients actually had less disabilit y confirmed at end of 6 y ears\\ncompared to the onset of the study .  Another antibody treatment, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), also showed in\\nclinical trials to reduced relapses almost in half and reduced contr ast MRI activit y by 95% compared to R ebif.\\nLemtr ada tr ansiently depletes T and B cells and Ocrevus consistently depletes B cells with potential\\nserious risks including serious infusion reactions and serious infections.\\nTreatment Stategies\\nOne common approach to treating multiple sclerosis is starting with a self -injected medication with two\\ndecades of long-term safet y information. These medications including Copax one (glatir amer acetate) and\\ninterferons (including A vonex, Betaseron, Exta via and R ebif )ha ve been effectiv e for man y patients without\\nimmune compromise. If new relapses, worsening disabilit y or uncheck ed MRI activit y occur , the first\\nmedication could be switched to another agent.   The str ategy is often referred to as “escalation” of\\ntreatment. This approach ma y be the safest option, but w aiting too long to switch ther apies ma y result in\\nirreversible disabilit y.\\nAnother str ategy is to seiz e the moment.   P eople living with MS without new relapses and without new MRI\\nactivit y have the best chance of prev enting disabilit y progression. One goal of MS treatment is achieving\\nNEDA (No Evidence of Disease Activit y) which means a patient is free of relapses, disabilit y progression and\\nMRI activit y. Choosing a high-powered medication first to minimiz e risk of worsening disabilit y to maximiz e\\nqualit y of life is another treatment approach. Early in MS there can be changes such as nerv e injury that ma y\\nlead to irrev ersible disabilit y. This earlier treatment approach  tackles the disease aggressiv ely from the start. \\nAccepting potential long-term risks of these immune ther apies with a lifelong disease is one concern. In\\naddition, the use of some of these immune treatments might restrict the next treatment option. Not all\\ntherapies are indicated for first -line ther apy in the United States.\\nLikely the best approach is a combination. This strategy involves stratifying the risk of disease, then matching\\nwith an appropriate medication.  Some risk factors that increase risk for disabilit y include being male, MS\\nonset after age 40, incomplete reco very from first attack, frequent relapses the first 2 y ears of disease, spinal\\ncord disease and higher amount of MS changes on initial MRI. P atients with lower risk of disabilit y progression\\nmay choose a more conserv ative medication option. In contr ast, someone at higher risk for disabilit y may be\\nwilling to accept more risk for more effectiv e treatment. It is critical for individuals living with MS to share\\ntheir willingness to accept or not accept certain risks to control their disease. Neurologists also v ary in their\\nwillingness to use higher risk medications which often influences the decision process.

An ex citing approach is rem yelination,  a process in\\nwhich new m yelin is made.   The m yelin coating on nerv e cells allows messages to tr avel rapidly such as from\\nthe br ain down the spinal cord.  Loss of the m yelin coating can dela y or block the messages getting to where\\nthey need to go .  Chronic m yelin loss ma y actually cause some nerv e cells to slowly die. \\nMyelin is formed from cells called oligos (short for oligodendrocytes) that wr ap around and around multiple\\nnerve cells.  In MS , the immune system attacks m yelin, causing tempor ary or permanent m yelin loss.\\nIn the human br ain, 5-8% of cells ha ve the potential to grow -up to be m yelin-making oligos.   These\\nimmature cells are called OPCs (oligodendrocyte precursor cells).   So how do we get these OPCs to create\\nnew m yelin and repair old damage?  \\nOne step is trying to mak e more of these OPC s.   Growth factors, such as PDGF- AA, can stimulate the OPCs\\nto divide and multiply .   Another approach is attr acting the potential m yelin-making cells into the MS plaques. \\nSemaphorin- 3F , for example, is a protein that can attr act OPCs to areas of loss of m yelin. Chemokines are\\nother compounds that can help OPCs to mo ve into a plaque for rem yelination.\\nRemoving factors that block rem yelination is a another w ay to try to repair m yelin.   High lev els of LINGO-1 ,\\nfor example, prev ent OPCs from maturing and making m yelin.  An antibody to LINGO-1 allowed for\\nremyelination to occur in animal models and is now being tested in human clinical trials.   Other antibody\\ntherapies are being dev eloped that stimulate rem yelination in animal models .  Whether these str ategies will\\nbe effectiv e and/or safe remains to be determined.\\nResearch has led the w ay to effectiv e treatments that reduce the immune attack against the br ain, spinal cord\\nand optic nerv es.

Recurrent  sharp pain.   Electrical, burning or recurrent stabbing pain sometimes occurs with MS ,\\nespecially on the head.  Sev ere bouts of pain lasting seconds to minutes from the ear to the ja w, cheek or\\nforehead is known as trigeminal neur algia.  T reatment options include gabapentin, o xycarbaz epine, and\\ntopiramate for recurrent intense bouts of pain.

Steroids\\nthrough the v ein would be the treatment of choice if significant visual loss.\\n4.  Bowel urgency.   While constipation is common in MS , some people ha ve little w arning when ha ving to\\nhave a bowel mo vement.   This problem can be distressing, especially if associated with bowel accidents. \\nSome meds that work on bladder sphincters such as Enablex can work for the bowel urgency .

Due to an attack in\\nthe thor acic spinal cord.  New onset?  IV steroids might be considered.  Gabapentin, Cymbalta, and baclofen\\nare possible medications that might pro vide relief .\\n6.  Hearing loss.    Uncommonly , the first symptom of MS .  Usually one side is affected and can be associated\\nwith spinning sensation, facial numbness and imbalance.    Best treated early with steroids in v ein.\\n7.  Flexor spasms.   Intense spells of in voluntary arm and leg muscle tightening.  The arms tend to curl up\\nwith the elbow bent and the hands clenched.  The spells usually last 30 seconds to 1 minute without loss of\\nconsciousness.  Often v ery painful.   T reatments options include baclofen, tizandine, o xcarbaz epine, and\\ngabapentin.\\n8.  Multitasking problems.    Man y people with MS ha ve problems with juggling multiple tasks at the same\\ntime.  Due to slowed thinking processing speed.   Best to minimiz e distr actions when focused on a challenging\\nproblem.   W orkplace accommodations such as location of desk in a busy office can be v ery useful. \\nOrganization is k ey: smartphones, emails,  folders, and lists.\\n9.  Sexual dysfunction.  Sometimes MS causes trouble achieving orgasm due to a lack of sensitivit y.  Men\\ncan dev elop erectile dysfunction.   A new change can be treated with steroids as a relapse.  F or decreased\\nsensitivit y, sexual aids ma y be useful.  Men frequently respond well to the erectile dysfunction medications. \\nSome anti-depressants can prev ent orgasm.\\n10.  Clonus.   Ever rest y our foot on the ground and the foot starts to bounce up and down repetitiv ely on its\\nown?  Clonus is an increase in reflex es that is seen commonly in people with significant stiffness or spasticit y\\nin the legs due to MS .  Does not need to be treated since resolv es when foot is mo ved.\\n11.  Leg cramps.   Due to spasticit y, MS can cause uncomfortable or painful cr amps in the legs.   Usually this\\noccurs during the night. A muscle relaxant such as baclofen or tizandine at bedtime can help if a regular\\nproblem.

This new study look ed at database of patient information recorded o ver 4-5 y ears\\nfrom British Columbia MS clinics.  A major difference is that this new Canadian study did not compare patients\\nrandomly  assigned to interferon or placebo as opposed to the older studies.  They simply compared patients\\nthat were treated with interferon to those patients nev er treated.

       " Document(page_content='the functioning of the brain and the impact of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)  \\nThe brain, part of the central nervous system (CNS), is composed of approximately 90 billion \\nnerve cells that are constantly active. These cells connect and communicate, forming a \\nnetwork more complex than the Milky Way. The CNS, which includes the brain, spinal cord, \\nand nerves in the eyes, allows us to perform various functions such as thinking, breathing, \\nfeeling, seeing, and navigating the world.  \\nHowever, in conditions like MS, the communication between nerve cells is disrupted. MS, a \\ndisease of the CN S, is a leading cause of nontraumatic disability in young adults, typically \\ndiagnosed between 20 and 40 years of age.  \\nNerve cells transmit messages through electrical signals along axons, which are coated with \\na fatty layer called myelin for efficient sig nal transmission. In MS, inflammation damages the \\nmyelin, altering signal transmission and leading to various problems. The inflamed areas can \\nbecome scarred as the body attempts to repair the damage, similar to how a scrape leaves a \\nscar on the skin.  \\nMS is unpredictable, with patients experiencing symptom relapses followed by symptom -free \\nperiods. Despite these symptom -free periods, MS can continue to damage the CNS. The \\nimmune system, which usually protects us, is implicated in the attack on the nervous system \\nin MS. Further details will be discussed in the next episode.  \\nIn summary, this text provides an overview of how the brain functions, the role of nerve cells \\nand myelin, and how MS disrupts this system, leading to various symptoms and \\ncomplications.  \\n \\nElucidating the multifaceted role of B cells in the pathophysiology of multiple \\nsclerosis.  \\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) stands as a significant cause of neurological disability, impacting \\napproximately 2.3 million individuals worldwide. Predominantly striking  individuals around \\nthe age of 30, it exhibits a pronounced predilection for women over men, with women being \\ndiagnosed at twice the rate. The clinical presentation of MS encompasses a broad spectrum \\nof symptoms, ranging from weakness in limbs, sensory dis turbances such as numbness and \\ntingling, balance and coordination issues, debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairments, to \\nvisual disturbances like blurred or double vision. The disease progression typically manifests \\nas a series of recurrent relapses and r emissions, yet for some, it evolves into a steadily \\nworsening disability from its onset.  \\nThe underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of MS revolve around inflammation and \\nneurodegeneration, which culminate in the destruction of myelin sheaths and axons, \\ndisrupting the transmission of neural signals. This cascade of events is facilitated by the \\nheightened permeability of the blood -brain barrier, permitting the infiltration of immune cells \\nsuch as macrophages, T cells, and notably, B cells into the central n ervous system (CNS). \\nTraditionally, MS has been largely attributed to CD4+ T cells, particularly in the initiation of \\ninflammatory cascades. However, emerging evidence underscores the substantial \\ninvolvement of B cells in the disease process.  \\nOriginating f rom the bone marrow, B cells undergo maturation and differentiation into various \\nsubsets, including autoreactive B cells capable of recognizing self -antigens. While healthy \\nindividuals possess regulatory mechanisms to curb the development of autoreactive B  cells, \\nin MS, a subset bypasses these checkpoints and matures into pathogenic effectors.

       " Document(page_content='within the CNS, these aberrant B cells contribute to MS pathogenesis through diverse \\nmechanisms:  \\n1. Antigen presentation: B cells process and present antigens to  T cells, triggering \\ninflammatory responses and fostering T cell activation.  \\n2. Antibody production: Differentiation of B cells into plasma cells results in the production of \\nantibodies targeting myelin and oligodendrocytes, instigating tissue injury.  \\n3. Cytokine regulation: B cells secrete cytokines that modulate the immune response, often \\nfavoring inflammation over protective responses.  \\n4. Formation of lymphoid structures: In the meninges of progressive MS patients, B cells \\norganize into ectopic lymphoid structures, perpetuating local inflammation and neuronal \\ndamage.  \\nThe aberrant development and activation of B cells, circumventing immune tolerance \\nmechanisms, contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of MS. Ongoing research \\nendeavors are exploring tar geted therapeutic approaches aimed at eliminating specific \\npathogenic B cell subsets to mitigate disease progression and improve patient outcomes.  \\nIn essence, the intricate involvement of B cells in MS pathophysiology underscores the \\nmultifaceted nature of  the disease process and underscores the potential for novel \\ntherapeutic interventions targeting B cell -mediated mechanisms.  \\n \\nUnderstanding the Impact of Inflammation and Disease Progression in Multiple \\nSclerosis  \\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex diseas e that affects the central nervous system, leading \\nto a variety of symptoms and challenges in daily life. One of the key aspects influencing the \\nprogression of MS is inflammation, which manifests in two forms: chronic and acute.  \\nInflammation as a Waterfall  Analogy:  \\nImagine inflammation as a waterfall. Chronic inflammation is like a steady flow of water, \\nalways present and ongoing. On the other hand, acute inflammation is akin to the waterfall \\nsurging after heavy rainfall, intensifying temporarily before sub siding. Both types of \\ninflammation gradually erode the underlying \"rocky earth,\" representing the central nervous \\nsystem, leading to irreversible damage and disease progression in MS.  \\nImpact on Everyday Life:  \\nThe effects of MS can permeate various aspects of a person\\'s life, from physical abilities to \\ncognitive functions and emotional well -being.  \\nPhysical Challenges: Symptoms like muscle weakness, spasticity, pain, numbness, impaired \\ncoordination, and slower reaction times can impair driving ability, reduci ng independence. \\nAdditionally, walking and performing daily tasks like carrying groceries become challenging \\ndue to muscle issues.  \\nCognitive and Emotional Impact: MS can affect cognitive functions, including thinking, \\nconcentration, organization, and memor y. Fatigue, speech difficulties, and vision problems \\nfurther complicate daily activities and may impact employability without necessary \\nadaptations.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 922}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Personal Relationships: MS can influence sexual arousal and response, potentially leading \\nto reduced intima cy and strain on relationships due to the interplay of physical symptoms \\nand emotional factors.  \\nBodily Functions: Loss of bladder and bowel control can result in an increased and urgent \\nneed to use the toilet, affecting daily routines and causing discomfor t. \\nThe Importance of Early Intervention:  \\nWhile MS poses significant challenges, disease -modifying therapies offer hope. Studies \\nindicate that initiating effective treatment early after diagnosis can substantially slow disease \\nprogression. This early intervention provides people with MS the opportunity to maintain their \\nindependence and quality of life for longer periods, reducing disruptions caused by the \\ndisease.  \\nIn conclusion, understanding the role of inflammation and the impact of disease progress ion \\nin MS underscores the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment. By acting swiftly and \\neffectively, individuals with MS can lead more fulfilling lives with fewer disruptions.  \\n \\nNavigating Multiple Sclerosis: The Car Analogy for Understanding Disease \\nProgression  \\nUnderstanding the complexities of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can be challenging, especially \\nwhen trying to convey its intricacies to patients, healthcare professionals (HCPs), and \\ncaregivers. To facilitate better conversations and comprehension ab out MS disease \\nprogression, an analogy likening the body to a car has been introduced.  \\nThe Body as a Car:  \\nIn this analogy, individuals with MS are likened to the drivers of a car, with their bodies \\nrepresenting the vehicle. As they drive, wear and tear occ ur, symbolizing the progression of \\nMS disease, which remains largely unseen beneath the \"bonnet\" or hood of the car.  \\nNeurological Reserve and Engine Functionality:  \\nJust as a car may experience an oil leak without immediate impact on its performance due to \\nthe engine\\'s ability to compensate, the brain has a neurological reserve. This reserve allows \\nthe brain to rewire itself temporarily, compensating for disruptions caused by MS. However, \\nover time, the accumulation of damage can lead to more significant iss ues, affecting the \\nbrain\\'s functions and impacting daily life.  \\nSymptoms and Functional Impairments:  \\nSimilar to a car\\'s radio malfunctioning or headlights dimming, MS can manifest in various \\nways, affecting mobility, cognition, and sensory functions. For in stance, mobility aids may \\nbecome necessary as MS progresses, mirroring a car requiring repair or maintenance to \\ncontinue functioning properly.  \\nChallenges and Support:  \\nEncountering unexpected issues like a flat tire can be likened to sudden MS exacerbations  \\nor symptoms that significantly impact daily activities. The experience of managing these \\nchallenges varies among individuals, influenced by access to healthcare professionals, \\nsupport systems, and personal resilience.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 923}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Taking Action and Maintenance:  \\nRecogn izing changes in the car's performance prompts the driver to seek a mechanic's \\nexpertise or refer to the car's manual for self -diagnosis and maintenance. Similarly, \\nindividuals with MS may consult neurologists, utilize self -management techniques, or seek \\ncommunity support to address symptoms and maintain quality of life.  \\nConclusion:  \\nThe car analogy serves as a relatable framework for understanding MS, emphasizing the \\nimportance of proactive management, timely interventions, and the role of support networks \\nin navigating the challenges posed by the disease. By equipping individuals with knowledge \\nand tools to address MS effectively, this analogy fosters empowerment and resilience in \\nmanaging the complexities of living with MS.  \\n \\nUnderstanding Multiple Sclerosi s: The Rail Network Analogy and Disease Progression  \\nThe Central Nervous System (CNS) serves as a vast network transmitting electrical signals \\nbetween nerve cells, much like a complex rail network with billions of trains traveling at \\nincredible speeds. This  intricate system facilitates communication throughout the body, \\nenabling various functions and responses.  \\nThe CNS as a Rail Network:  \\nVisualizing the CNS as a rail network helps illustrate the impact of inflammation and damage \\ncaused by Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Just as damaged tracks can be repaired only so many \\ntimes before becoming irreparable, the CNS faces similar challenges. In MS, inflammation \\ndamages the CNS, leading to potential repairs by the body. However, when repair \\nmechanisms fail, the result i s the loss of nerve cells and fibers, marking the onset of disease \\nprogression.  \\n \\nDisease Progression and Invisible Symptoms:  \\nDisease progression in MS begins early, often before diagnosis, and affects all forms of the \\ndisease. Unlike visible disabilities, some MS symptoms may remain hidden due to the CNS's \\nability to compensate through neurological reserve. This compensation involves rerouting \\nsignals through undamaged areas or adapting undamaged regions to assume new \\nfunctions.  \\nDetecting Disease Progressio n: \\nEarly detection of disease progression can be challenging, as the CNS can compensate for \\na loss of nerve cells and fibers initially. However, when the CNS reaches its capacity to \\ncompensate, symptoms become more noticeable, and disability may worsen. Re gular MRI \\nscans can help measure brain tissue loss over time, aiding in tracking disease progression.  \\nImportance of Early Intervention:  \\nEarly treatment with therapies targeting disease progression, rather than just relapses, is \\ncrucial in minimizing perman ent nerve cell loss and mitigating the long -term impact of MS on \\ndaily life. Collaborative efforts, such as Roche's partnership with research institutes and \\nother companies, aim to develop innovative tools and biological markers to identify and \\npotentially  predict individual progression patterns.\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 924}),\n",

We are all volunteers, except for our two indispensable office \\nassistants – Rajkumar and Shashi, who all of our MSP’s must be familiar with!\\nAt the time of printing, we have a database of over 750 PwMS members registered with \\nus. These MS persons are spread over all of North India -  Delhi NCR, and neighbouring \\nstates of UP, Haryana & Rajasthan. We also have members from Punjab ,Himachal, \\nUttarakhand , J&K, and some from even as far as Bihar, MP & Jharkhand. It remains our \\nmission to get to know each and every one of them & keep in touch with them through \\nphone, Email & letters. We interact with our PwMS’ s in so many ways, we touch their lives \\nin so many aspects and realise that they are so much a part of our daily lives as well ! \\nA lot of MSps who first get in touch with us always ask one question-“What does MSSI do ? \\nHow can you help me?” \\nDo you really know what all MSSI Delhi \\ndoes?  \\nToday, let us welcome you into our world and \\nintroduce you to our various activities. We are \\nalways looking for ways to interact with our \\nmembers- whether it is through Home Visits, or \\nDay Care events or medical camps.\\nWe also organise trained physio therapists visits \\nin the comfort of their own homes, visits by an \\nattendant for helping with daily care bath etc of \\nour female patients.\\nMSSI Delhi distributes medical & mobilit y aids, organises doctor appointments on \\npriorit y, interacts with them on various WhatsApp chat groups dedicated to MS persons. \\n5', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 967}),\n",

A lot of planning goes \\ninto preparing for these events. Not only do we have to make sure that the venue is easily \\naccessible to all those who come, but we also try to make transport arrangements for \\nmany of our participants who are housebound & dependent.  We also must take into \\nconsider ation the fact that fatigue is a major part of their lives, so the events should not \\nlast too long and should be in an air-conditioned environment. Our volunteers work very \\nhard to make these events go smoothly and make sure that every one of our special \\nguests has a great time.\\nDay Care Events: \\nThese are our most popular events. These are regular progr ammes which are \\neducational, social or merely fun activities. They include medical seminars, talks by \\ndoctors and motiv ational speak ers, entertainers, celebr ations of festiv als, music & \\nlaughter . \\nFrequently , we organise an event where our MSP’s and their caretak ers are invited to \\nwatch a movie, spend a fun day at the Mall and play games, along with a meal served by \\nus. On these occasions we get a chance to spend some relaxed time with each other, \\ninteract with the caretak ers and other MSps and \\nfamilies.\\nA Day at the Mall\\nSelect City Walk has been one of our most \\ngenerous patrons for many years. Once again on \\n15 September 2019 they organised a movie \\nshow for our MSP’s and a sumptuous lunch for \\nthem.W e gathered in their Training Centre at the \\nMall, where we danced and sang and told jokes. \\nThe MSP’s also played Tambola, they also got a \\nchance to have their caricatures drawn by a \\ncaricature artist who was really the star of that \\nevent!

Once again, this year, on a beautiful October afternoon we gathered \\nat the Club lawns to share our joy. \\nThere were gifts for all, there was great food, jokes and laughter and a festiv e \\natmosphere. \\nThe Rehnuma band, consisting of Karan on the guitar and Ashu on the vocals were really , \\ngood!

They are coping with life in \\namazing ways and we feel proud of them. Their never-say-die attitude astonishes us and \\nmakes us feel proud of them.\\n·\\x00\\x00Some of them are lonely and depressed- and all they need is a kind word, or someone to say \\nwe care.

Or just change their mind at the \\nlast minute ..This puts our entire schedule out of gear. This actually also results in some other \\nfamily missing out on a visit that they were really keen on.. which is a bit unfair , don't you \\nthink ? \\n·\\x00\\x00Occasionally an MSP may be having an emotional issue and may refuse to meet us. It takes a \\nlot of patience to get them to agree to just talk to us for a few minutes. Often, they agree and \\nopen up to us.\\n·\\x00Some expect us to provide them with solutions to family issues, legal help, disabilit y \\ncertificates or solve their money problems. Once again, we must patiently inform them that \\nwe are volunteers and there are limitations to what we can do. \\n  But all said and done, we enjoy these visits. We are greeted with immense enthusiasm, we \\nare plied with food and snacks and often the whole family gathers around us and chats with \\nus, making us feel so welcome. \\nWe promise to continue making these visits and if you would like us to visit you \\nsometime soon do inform our office staff.\\n9\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\RAHUL\\\\Desktop\\\\chatbot_new\\\\chatbot\\\\ilovepdf_merged.pdf', 'page': 971}),\n",

      " The history of cancer treatments through surgery can be traced back to the late 19th century with the work of surgeons like Bilroth in Germany, Handley in London, and Halsted in Baltimore. Halsted, specifically, developed the radical mastectomy for breast cancer based on the belief that cancer spreads primarily by local invasion rather than through the bloodstream. This belief led to the removal of entire tumors along with nearby lymph nodes, a practice that remained standard for almost a century. However, modern clinical trials in the 1970s demonstrated that less extensive surgery is equally effective for most women with breast cancer, leading to the decline of radical mastectomies and the rise of modified radical mastectomies and lumpectomies with radiation therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, during this time, surgeons like Handley and Halsted were developing radical operations while Stephen Paget was asking questions about metastasis. Paget's hypothesis that cells spread throughout the body but could only grow in certain organs became a key element in recognizing the limitations of cancer surgery and eventually led to the development of systemic treatments used after surgery to destroy cells that had spread throughout the body. Today, these systemic treatments may also be used before surgery."

      " Genes are segments of DNA that contain the instructions for the production of a specific protein or RNA molecule. In the context of cancer, genes can be altered or mutated in various ways, leading to the development and growth of cancer cells. These genetic changes can be caused by various factors such as inherited gene mutations, environmental exposures, viruses, or errors during DNA replication. Understanding the role of genes in cancer is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies, early detection methods, and targeted treatments. Genomic testing, which involves analyzing the genetic material of cancer cells, plays a significant role in identifying these genetic changes and guiding personalized treatment plans."

      " An alpha blocker is a type of medication used to treat certain medical conditions, including high blood pressure and urinary symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate (a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Alpha blockers work by blocking the action of alpha-adrenergic receptors in the body, which helps relax smooth muscles in the blood vessels and the bladder neck. This can lead to improved blood flow and reduced urinary symptoms. Examples of alpha blockers include phentolamine, phenylephrine, timolol, brimonidine, and doxazosin."
